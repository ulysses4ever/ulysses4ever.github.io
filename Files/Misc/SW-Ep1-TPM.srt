1
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,658
- Captain.
- Yes, sir?

2
00:02:00,794 --> 00:02:02,917
Tell them we wish
to board at once.

3
00:02:04,422 --> 00:02:05,832
With all due respect...

4
00:02:05,966 --> 00:02:09,169
the ambassadors for the supreme
chancellor wish to board immediately.

5
00:02:09,302 --> 00:02:11,175
Yes, of course.

6
00:02:11,304 --> 00:02:14,388
As you know,
our blockade is perfectly legal...

7
00:02:14,516 --> 00:02:18,596
and we'd be happy
to receive the ambassadors.

8
00:02:41,085 --> 00:02:43,706
I'm TC-14 at your service.

9
00:02:43,838 --> 00:02:45,711
This way, please.

10
00:02:51,846 --> 00:02:54,882
We are greatly honoured
by your visit, Ambassadors.

11
00:02:55,016 --> 00:02:56,889
Make yourselves comfortable.

12
00:02:57,018 --> 00:02:59,343
My master
will be with you shortly.

13
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:05,521
I have a bad feeling about this.

14
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:08,653
- I don't sense anything.
- It's not about the mission, Master.

15
00:03:08,781 --> 00:03:12,695
It's something elsewhere, elusive.

16
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:15,198
Don't centre on your anxieties,
Obi-Wan.

17
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:18,448
Keep your concentration here and now,
where it belongs.

18
00:03:18,582 --> 00:03:21,417
But Master Yoda said
I should be mindful of the future.

19
00:03:21,544 --> 00:03:23,536
But not at the expense
of the moment.

20
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:26,588
Be mindful of the living Force,
young Padawan.

21
00:03:26,716 --> 00:03:28,625
Yes, Master.

22
00:03:30,845 --> 00:03:34,463
How do you think this trade viceroy
will deal with the chancellor's demands?

23
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:36,722
These Federation types are cowards.

24
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:39,686
The negotiations will be short.

25
00:03:40,563 --> 00:03:43,101
What? What did you say?

26
00:03:43,233 --> 00:03:46,187
The ambassadors are Jedi knights,
I believe.

27
00:03:46,945 --> 00:03:48,143
I knew it.

28
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,521
They're here to force a settlement.

29
00:03:51,867 --> 00:03:54,951
Distract them.
I will contact Lord Sidious.

30
00:03:55,078 --> 00:03:56,655
Are you brain-dead?

31
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:59,624
I'm not going in there
with two Jedi.

32
00:04:01,293 --> 00:04:02,703
Send a droid.

33
00:04:08,175 --> 00:04:10,048
Is it in their nature
to make us wait this long?

34
00:04:10,177 --> 00:04:12,465
No. I sense
an unusual amount of fear...

35
00:04:12,597 --> 00:04:14,720
for something as trivial
as this trade dispute.

36
00:04:25,652 --> 00:04:27,525
What is it?

37
00:04:27,654 --> 00:04:30,323
This scheme of yours has failed,
Lord Sidious.

38
00:04:30,448 --> 00:04:33,982
The blockade is finished.
We dare not go against these Jedi.

39
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:38,911
Viceroy, I don't want
this stunted slime in my sight again.

40
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:44,336
This turn of events is unfortunate.
We must accelerate our plans.

41
00:04:44,463 --> 00:04:47,001
Begin landing your troops.

42
00:04:47,132 --> 00:04:50,832
My lord, is that legal?

43
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,258
I will make it legal.

44
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:55,677
And the Jedi?

45
00:04:55,808 --> 00:04:58,299
The chancellor should never have
brought them into this.

46
00:04:58,436 --> 00:05:00,179
Kill them immediately.

47
00:05:00,313 --> 00:05:04,607
Yes, my lord.
As you wish.

48
00:05:06,486 --> 00:05:08,277
Captain, look!

49
00:05:09,405 --> 00:05:10,780
Shields-

50
00:05:14,285 --> 00:05:16,158
Sorry.

51
00:05:17,914 --> 00:05:19,787
Dioxis.

52
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:27,244
They must be dead by now.

53
00:05:27,382 --> 00:05:30,051
Destroy what's left of them.

54
00:05:38,185 --> 00:05:40,557
Oh! Excuse me.

55
00:05:40,688 --> 00:05:43,642
- Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you.
- Roger, roger.

56
00:05:44,608 --> 00:05:46,268
Uh-oh. Blast them.

57
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:53,575
What is going on down there?

58
00:05:53,701 --> 00:05:55,658
We lost the transmission, sir.

59
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:03,167
Have you ever encountered
a Jedi knight before, sir?

60
00:06:03,294 --> 00:06:06,248
Well, no, but I don't-
Seal off the bridge.

61
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:09,085
- Yes, sir.
- That won't be enough, sir.

62
00:06:09,217 --> 00:06:11,174
I want droidekas
up here at once!

63
00:06:11,303 --> 00:06:13,841
We will not survive this.

64
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:26,811
Close the blast doors!

65
00:06:33,451 --> 00:06:35,609
That will hold them.

66
00:06:44,087 --> 00:06:46,791
They are still coming through.

67
00:06:46,923 --> 00:06:48,832
This is impossible!

68
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:56,181
Where are those droidekas?

69
00:06:57,767 --> 00:06:59,510
Master! Destroyers!

70
00:07:05,942 --> 00:07:07,317
They have shield generators!

71
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:11,483
It's a standoff.
Let's go.

72
00:07:15,661 --> 00:07:18,152
They're no match for droidekas.

73
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:19,949
Sir!

74
00:07:20,082 --> 00:07:22,751
They've gone up
the ventilation shaft.

75
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:34,221
- Battle droids.
- It's an invasion army.

76
00:07:35,974 --> 00:07:38,643
This is an odd play
for the Trade Federation.

77
00:07:38,768 --> 00:07:41,852
We've got to warn the Naboo
and contact Chancellor Valorum.

78
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,522
Let's split up.

79
00:07:43,648 --> 00:07:46,851
Stow aboard separate ships
and meet down on the planet.

80
00:07:46,985 --> 00:07:48,811
You were right
about one thing, Master.

81
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:53,450
The negotiations were short.

82
00:07:54,618 --> 00:07:57,025
Sir, a transmission
from the planet.

83
00:07:57,162 --> 00:07:59,238
It's Queen Amidala herself.

84
00:07:59,373 --> 00:08:01,780
At last we are getting results.

85
00:08:03,168 --> 00:08:06,169
Again you come before us,
Your Highness.

86
00:08:06,297 --> 00:08:09,381
You will not be so pleased when you hear
what I have to say, Viceroy.

87
00:08:09,508 --> 00:08:13,208
Your trade boycott
of our planet has ended.

88
00:08:13,346 --> 00:08:15,884
I was not aware of such failure.

89
00:08:16,015 --> 00:08:18,719
I have word that the chancellor's
ambassadors are with you now...

90
00:08:18,851 --> 00:08:21,555
and that you have been commanded
to reach settlement.

91
00:08:21,687 --> 00:08:23,928
I know nothing
of any ambassadors.

92
00:08:24,065 --> 00:08:26,437
You must be mistaken.

93
00:08:26,568 --> 00:08:28,560
Beware, Viceroy.

94
00:08:28,695 --> 00:08:31,399
The Federation
has gone too far this time.

95
00:08:31,531 --> 00:08:35,575
We would never do anything
without the approval of the senate.

96
00:08:35,702 --> 00:08:38,193
You assume too much.

97
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,705
We will see.

98
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:45,330
- She's right. The senate will never-
- It's too late now.

99
00:08:45,462 --> 00:08:48,416
- Do you think she suspects an attack?
- I don't know.

100
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:52,878
But we must move quickly to disrupt
all communications down there.

101
00:08:58,392 --> 00:09:02,140
Negotiations haven't started
because the ambassadors aren't there?

102
00:09:02,271 --> 00:09:04,429
How could that be true?

103
00:09:04,565 --> 00:09:08,894
I have assurances from the chancellor
his ambassadors did arrive.

104
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:12,776
It must- handiwork-
negotiate- ambassadors-

105
00:09:12,907 --> 00:09:15,528
- nobody would-
- Senator Palpatine.

106
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,533
What's happening?

107
00:09:17,662 --> 00:09:19,535
Check the transmission generator.

108
00:09:19,664 --> 00:09:24,491
A communications disruption
can mean only one thing: invasion.

109
00:09:24,628 --> 00:09:26,916
The Federation
would not dare go that far.

110
00:09:27,047 --> 00:09:30,831
The senate would revoke their trade
franchise, and they'd be finished.

111
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:33,802
We must continue to rely
on negotiation.

112
00:09:33,929 --> 00:09:37,132
Negotiation?
We've lost all communications.

113
00:09:37,266 --> 00:09:39,591
And where are
the chancellor's ambassadors?

114
00:09:40,936 --> 00:09:43,391
This is a dangerous situation,
Your Highness.

115
00:09:43,522 --> 00:09:45,598
Our security volunteers
will be no match...

116
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:47,856
against a battle-hardened
Federation army.

117
00:09:49,445 --> 00:09:53,145
I will not condone a course of action
that will lead us to war.

118
00:10:29,611 --> 00:10:32,695
- Yes, Viceroy?
- Captain, we've searched the ship...

119
00:10:32,823 --> 00:10:34,946
and there is no trace of theJedi.

120
00:10:35,075 --> 00:10:37,826
They may have gotten on
one of your landing craft.

121
00:10:37,953 --> 00:10:40,408
If they're down here, sir,
we'll find them.

122
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:44,868
Use caution.
TheseJedi are not to be underestimated.

123
00:10:58,683 --> 00:11:00,474
- Oh, no!
- Get away! Get out of here!

124
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,303
Get down!

125
00:11:13,323 --> 00:11:16,193
Was'n dat?
Hey, wait!

126
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,862
Oh, mooie-mooie,
I love you.

127
00:11:18,996 --> 00:11:21,035
You almost got us killed.
Are you brainless?

128
00:11:21,165 --> 00:11:22,789
I spake.

129
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:25,040
The ability to speak
does not make you intelligent.

130
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:28,039
- Now, get out of here.
- No, no, mesa stay.

131
00:11:28,172 --> 00:11:31,208
Mesa culled Jar Jar Binks.
Mesa your humble servant.

132
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:33,418
- That won't be necessary.
- Oh, but it 'tis.

133
00:11:33,553 --> 00:11:36,423
'Tis demanded by the gods, it 'tis.

134
00:11:36,556 --> 00:11:38,465
- Oh, no!
- Stay down!

135
00:11:46,816 --> 00:11:48,559
You saved my again.

136
00:11:48,693 --> 00:11:50,566
- What's this?
- A local.

137
00:11:50,695 --> 00:11:53,233
Let's get out of here
before more droids show up.

138
00:11:53,365 --> 00:11:56,734
More?
"More" did you spake?

139
00:11:56,868 --> 00:12:01,743
Ex-squeeze-me, but de mostest
safest place would be Gunga City.

140
00:12:01,874 --> 00:12:05,077
Is where I grew up.
'Tis a hidden city.

141
00:12:06,712 --> 00:12:08,585
- A city?
- Uh-huh.

142
00:12:08,714 --> 00:12:10,505
Can you take us there?

143
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,841
On second thought, no.

144
00:12:12,968 --> 00:12:15,459
- Not really, no.
- No?

145
00:12:15,596 --> 00:12:17,719
'Tis embarrassing...

146
00:12:17,848 --> 00:12:21,797
but my afraid
my've been banished.

147
00:12:21,936 --> 00:12:25,020
My forgotten. Da bosses
would do terrible tings to me.

148
00:12:25,148 --> 00:12:28,184
Terrible tings to me
if me goen back dare.

149
00:12:28,318 --> 00:12:31,319
- You hear that?
- Yah.

150
00:12:31,446 --> 00:12:35,194
That is the sound of a thousand
terrible things heading this way.

151
00:12:35,325 --> 00:12:37,898
If they find us,
they will crush us...

152
00:12:38,036 --> 00:12:42,579
grind us into tiny pieces
and blast us into oblivion.

153
00:12:42,707 --> 00:12:44,415
Oh.

154
00:12:44,543 --> 00:12:46,619
Yousa point is well seen.

155
00:12:46,753 --> 00:12:49,078
Dis way. Hurry!

156
00:12:54,386 --> 00:12:57,671
- How much further?
- Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

157
00:12:57,806 --> 00:12:59,679
Ah, my warning you.

158
00:12:59,808 --> 00:13:03,936
Gungans no liken outsiders,
so don't spect a warm welcome.

159
00:13:04,063 --> 00:13:07,396
Don't worry. This hasn't been
our day for warm welcomes.

160
00:13:17,827 --> 00:13:20,234

Hey, yousa.
Stopa dare.

163
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,891
Heyo-dales, Cap'n Tarpals.

00:14:30,027 --> 00:14:31,900
Mesa back.

165

Noah gain,Jar Jar.
Yousa goen tada bosses.

166
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,695
Yousa in big dudu dis time.

00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:45,076
How wude.

168
00:14:53,718 --> 00:14:56,125
Yousa cannot bees hair.

169
00:14:56,262 --> 00:15:00,805
Dis army of Mackineeks
up dare is new weesong.

170
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:05,809
A droid army is about to attack
the Naboo. We must warn them.

171
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:09,521
Wesa no like da Naboo.

172
00:15:09,651 --> 00:15:12,438
Da Naboo tink day so smarty.

173
00:15:12,571 --> 00:15:15,488
Day tink day brains so big.

174
00:15:15,616 --> 00:15:19,744
Once those droids take control of the
surface, they will take control of you.

175
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,158
Mesa no tink so.

176
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:25,159
Day not know of uss-en.

177
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:28,209
You and the Naboo form
a symbiont circle.

178
00:15:28,337 --> 00:15:31,706
What happens to one of you will affect
the other. You must understand this.

179
00:15:31,841 --> 00:15:36,633
Wesa no carrrre-nn about da Naboo.

180
00:15:36,762 --> 00:15:39,300
Then speed us on our way.

181
00:15:39,432 --> 00:15:41,923
Wesa ganna speed yous away.

182
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,847
We could use a transport.

183
00:15:44,979 --> 00:15:47,814
Wesa give yousa una bongo.

184
00:15:47,941 --> 00:15:51,025
Da speediest way tooda Naboo...

185
00:15:51,152 --> 00:15:55,861
'tis goen through the planet core.

186
00:15:55,991 --> 00:15:57,864
Now...

187
00:15:57,993 --> 00:15:59,784
go.

188
00:15:59,911 --> 00:16:02,152
Thank you for your help.
We leave in peace.

189
00:16:02,289 --> 00:16:04,328
Master, what's a bongo?

190
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,415
A transport, I hope.

191
00:16:06,543 --> 00:16:08,619
Deysa setten yousa up.

192
00:16:08,754 --> 00:16:12,372
Goen through da planet core?
Bad bombin'.

193
00:16:13,884 --> 00:16:16,671
Any help here would be hot.

194
00:16:18,013 --> 00:16:19,886
Master, we're short on time.

195
00:16:21,017 --> 00:16:23,638
We'll need a navigator to get us
through the planet's core.

196
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:25,726
This Gungan may be of help.

197
00:16:27,857 --> 00:16:30,893
What is to become
of Jar Jar Binks here?

198
00:16:31,027 --> 00:16:35,938
Hisen to be pune-ished.

199
00:16:36,866 --> 00:16:38,241
I saved his life.

200
00:16:38,368 --> 00:16:40,859
He owes me
what you call a "life-debt. "

201
00:16:40,996 --> 00:16:44,828
Your gods demand
that his life belongs to me now.

202
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,283
Binks...

203
00:16:47,419 --> 00:16:51,368
yousa havena liveplay
with thisen hisen?

204
00:16:58,138 --> 00:16:59,964
Begone wit him!

205
00:17:02,643 --> 00:17:05,015
Count me outta dis one.

206
00:17:05,146 --> 00:17:08,265
Better dead here
than dead in da core.

207
00:17:08,399 --> 00:17:11,518
Yee gods!
What mesa sayin?

208
00:17:29,754 --> 00:17:32,541
Dis is nutsen.
Oh, gooberfish!

209
00:17:32,674 --> 00:17:35,924
- Why were you banished,Jar Jar?
- It's a longo tale-o...

210
00:17:36,052 --> 00:17:41,093
buta a small part of it
would be mesa... clumsy.

211
00:17:41,225 --> 00:17:46,017
- You were banished for being clumsy?
- Yousa might'n be sayin dat.

212
00:17:58,951 --> 00:18:03,162
Mesa caused mabee one two-y
lettle bitty axadentes, huh?

213
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:05,328
Yud-say boom da gasser...

214
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:08,245
den crashin der boss's heyblibber,
den banished.

215
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,586
Big gooberfish!
Huge-o teeth!

216
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:32,442
- There's always a bigger fish.
- Mesa tink we goen back now.

217
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:47,034
The invasion is on schedule,
my lord.

218
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:50,169
I have the senate
bogged down in procedures.

219
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:54,708
They will have no choice but
to accept your control of the system.

220
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:59,551
The queen has great faith
that the senate will side with her.

221
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:02,635
Queen Amidala is young and naive.

222
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:06,218
You will find controlling her
will not be difficult.

223
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:08,227
Yes, my lord.

224
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:12,561
You didn't tell him
about the missing Jedi.

225
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:17,190
No need to report that to him
until we have something to report.

226
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:25,403
- Where wesa goin?
- Don't worry. The Force will guide us.

227
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,328
Oh, maxi big, da Force.

228
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:31,245
Well, dat smells stinkowiff.

229
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:35,003
- We're losing power.
- Oh, no!

230
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:43,214
Wesa dyin' here.

231
00:19:43,351 --> 00:19:46,020
- Just relax. We're not in trouble yet.
- What "yet"?

232
00:19:46,145 --> 00:19:49,099
Monsters out dare.
Leak'n in here.

233
00:19:49,232 --> 00:19:54,190
All sink'n and no power?
Whena yousa tinkin wesa in trouble?

234
00:19:55,488 --> 00:19:57,776
Power's back.

235
00:19:57,908 --> 00:19:59,984
Monster's back!

236
00:20:07,834 --> 00:20:09,577
Relax.

237
00:20:09,711 --> 00:20:11,169
You overdid it.

238
00:20:27,939 --> 00:20:29,978
Head for that outcropping.

239
00:20:30,108 --> 00:20:32,017
Oh, boy.

240
00:21:07,354 --> 00:21:09,430
Viceroy, we have captured the queen.

241
00:21:09,565 --> 00:21:12,234
Ah, victory.

242
00:21:25,748 --> 00:21:27,906
Dis'n loverly.

243
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,415
How will you explain this invasion
to the senate?

244
00:21:36,551 --> 00:21:40,714
The queen and I will sign a treaty that
will legitimize our occupation here.

245
00:21:40,847 --> 00:21:44,013
I have assurances
it will be ratified by the senate.

246
00:21:44,142 --> 00:21:47,593
- I will not cooperate.
- Now, now, Your Highness.

247
00:21:47,729 --> 00:21:51,857
In time, your people's suffering will
persuade you to see our point of view.

248
00:21:53,193 --> 00:21:55,102
- Commander.
- Yes, sir.

249
00:21:55,237 --> 00:21:56,861
Process them.

250
00:21:56,989 --> 00:21:58,780
Captain, take them to Camp 4.

251
00:21:58,908 --> 00:22:00,532
Roger, roger.

252
00:22:55,424 --> 00:22:57,630
We should leave the street,
Your Highness.

253
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,384
Get their weapons.

254
00:23:01,222 --> 00:23:03,463
Yousa guys bombad!

255
00:23:05,101 --> 00:23:07,473
We're ambassadors
for the supreme chancellor.

256
00:23:07,604 --> 00:23:09,477
Your negotiations seemed
to have failed, Ambassador.

257
00:23:09,606 --> 00:23:11,432
The negotiations
never took place.

258
00:23:11,566 --> 00:23:13,938
It's urgent that we make contact
with the Republic.

259
00:23:14,069 --> 00:23:16,145
They've knocked out
all our communications.

260
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:19,612
- Do you have transports?
- In the main hangar. This way.

261
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,664
- There are too many of them.
- That won't be a problem.

262
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:31,325
Your Highness, under the circumstances,
I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.

263
00:23:31,462 --> 00:23:34,498
Thank you, Ambassador,
but my place is with my people.

264
00:23:34,632 --> 00:23:37,336
- They will kill you if you stay.
- They wouldn't dare.

265
00:23:37,468 --> 00:23:39,507
They need her to sign a treaty
to make this invasion legal.

266
00:23:39,637 --> 00:23:41,179
They can't afford to kill her.

267
00:23:41,305 --> 00:23:43,428
There is something else behind all this,
Your Highness.

268
00:23:43,558 --> 00:23:45,515
There's no logic
in the Federation's move here.

269
00:23:45,643 --> 00:23:47,600
My feelings tell me
they will destroy you.

270
00:23:47,729 --> 00:23:50,101
Our only hope is for the senate
to side with us.

271
00:23:50,231 --> 00:23:52,686
Senator Palpatine
will need your help.

272
00:23:52,817 --> 00:23:56,766
Either choice presents great danger...
to us all.

273
00:23:56,905 --> 00:23:58,778
We are brave, Your Highness.

274
00:23:58,907 --> 00:24:02,157
If you are to leave,
Your Highness, it must be now.

275
00:24:02,285 --> 00:24:04,740
Then I will plead our case
to the senate.

276
00:24:05,789 --> 00:24:07,580
Be careful, Governor.

277
00:24:16,508 --> 00:24:18,584
We'll need to free those pilots.

278
00:24:19,845 --> 00:24:21,718
I'll deal with that.

279
00:24:25,184 --> 00:24:26,215
Halt.

280
00:24:26,352 --> 00:24:28,012
I'm ambassador
to the supreme chancellor.

281
00:24:28,145 --> 00:24:29,722
I'm taking these people to Coruscant.

282
00:24:29,855 --> 00:24:33,058
- Where are you taking them?
- To Coruscant.

283
00:24:33,192 --> 00:24:35,813
Coruscant?
Uh, that doesn't compute.

284
00:24:35,945 --> 00:24:37,854
Uh, wait.
Uh, you're under arrest.

285
00:24:43,328 --> 00:24:44,526
Come on. Move!

286
00:24:49,918 --> 00:24:50,866
Go!

287
00:25:16,445 --> 00:25:19,730
Now, stay here
and keep out of trouble.

288
00:25:23,536 --> 00:25:25,694
Hello, boyos.

289
00:25:32,045 --> 00:25:33,669
There's the blockade.

290
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:45,723
The shield generator's been hit!

291
00:25:54,234 --> 00:25:55,811
How wude!

292
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,407
We're losing droids fast.

293
00:26:08,249 --> 00:26:10,870
If we can't get the shield generator
fixed, we'll be sitting ducks.

294
00:26:13,046 --> 00:26:14,291
The shields are gone.

295
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,758
The power's back!

296
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:30,011
That little droid did it.
He bypassed the main power drive.

297
00:26:30,147 --> 00:26:32,720
Deflector shields up at maximum.

298
00:26:42,326 --> 00:26:46,026
There's not enough power to get us
to Coruscant. The hyperdrive is leaking.

299
00:26:46,163 --> 00:26:49,033
We'll have to land somewhere
to refuel and repair the ship.

300
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:51,324
Here, Master.
Tatooine.

301
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,120
It's small, out of the way, poor.

302
00:26:53,254 --> 00:26:54,997
The Trade Federation
have no presence there.

303
00:26:55,131 --> 00:26:57,004
How can you be sure?

304
00:26:57,133 --> 00:26:59,042
It's controlled by the Hutts.

305
00:26:59,177 --> 00:27:01,964
You can't take Her Royal Highness there.
The Hutts are gangsters.

306
00:27:02,096 --> 00:27:04,384
- If they discovered her-
- It'd be no different than landing...

307
00:27:04,515 --> 00:27:06,388
on a system controlled
by the Federation...

308
00:27:06,518 --> 00:27:08,594
except that the Hutts
aren't looking for her...

309
00:27:08,728 --> 00:27:10,804
which gives us the advantage.

310
00:27:15,277 --> 00:27:18,278
And Queen Amidala,
has she signed the treaty?

311
00:27:18,405 --> 00:27:22,023
She has disappeared, my lord.

312
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,322
One Naboo cruiser
got past the blockade.

313
00:27:26,997 --> 00:27:29,369
I want that treaty signed.

314
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,539
My lord...

315
00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:34,207
it's impossible to locate the ship.

316
00:27:34,338 --> 00:27:36,544
It's out of our range.

317
00:27:36,674 --> 00:27:38,915
Not for a Sith.

318
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:41,383
This is my apprentice...

319
00:27:41,512 --> 00:27:43,421
Darth Maul.

320
00:27:44,765 --> 00:27:48,050
He will find your lost ship.

321
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:54,686
This is getting out of hand.

322
00:27:54,817 --> 00:27:56,856
Now there are two of them.

323
00:27:56,986 --> 00:27:59,987
We should not
have made this bargain.

324
00:28:05,287 --> 00:28:08,821
An extremely well-put-together
little droid, Your Highness.

325
00:28:08,957 --> 00:28:11,827
Without a doubt, it saved the ship,
as well as our lives.

326
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,293
It is to be commended.
What is its number?

327
00:28:17,966 --> 00:28:20,089
R2-D2, Your Highness.

328
00:28:20,219 --> 00:28:21,629
Thank you, R2-D2.

329
00:28:25,432 --> 00:28:26,842
Padmé.

330
00:28:28,394 --> 00:28:30,517
Clean this droid up
as best you can.

331
00:28:30,646 --> 00:28:32,603
It deserves our gratitude.

332
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,942
Continue, Captain.

333
00:28:38,905 --> 00:28:40,731
Your Highness,
with your permission...

334
00:28:40,865 --> 00:28:43,616
we're heading for a remote planet
called Tatooine.

335
00:28:43,743 --> 00:28:47,076
It's in a system far beyond the reach
of the Trade Federation.

336
00:28:47,205 --> 00:28:49,778
I do not agree
with the Jedi on this.

337
00:28:49,916 --> 00:28:52,833
You must trust my judgment,
Your Highness.

338
00:28:56,256 --> 00:28:57,964
Hello.

339
00:28:58,091 --> 00:29:01,045
Sorry. Husa are yousa?

340
00:29:02,221 --> 00:29:03,631
I'm Padmé.

341
00:29:04,765 --> 00:29:06,757
Mesa Jar Jar Binks.

342
00:29:07,601 --> 00:29:08,881
You're a Gungan, aren't you?

343
00:29:11,188 --> 00:29:14,770
- How'd you end up here with us?
- My no know.

344
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:18,565
Mesa day starten pitty okeyday
witda brisky morning munchen.

345
00:29:18,696 --> 00:29:21,483
Den boom!
Getten berry scared...

346
00:29:21,616 --> 00:29:24,901
and grabben dat Jedi, and pow-
mesa here.

347
00:29:26,287 --> 00:29:28,778
Mesa getten
berry, berry scared.

348
00:29:35,088 --> 00:29:38,172
- That's it- Tatooine.
- There's a settlement.

349
00:29:38,299 --> 00:29:42,379
Land near the outskirts.
We don't want to attract attention.

350
00:29:59,655 --> 00:30:02,442
The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master.
We'll need a new one.

351
00:30:02,575 --> 00:30:05,030
That'll complicate things.
Be wary.

352
00:30:05,161 --> 00:30:08,280
- I sense a disturbance in the Force.
- I feel it also, Master.

353
00:30:08,414 --> 00:30:10,453
Don't let them send
any transmissions.

354
00:30:16,547 --> 00:30:18,954
The sun doen murder to mesa skin.

355
00:30:19,092 --> 00:30:20,586
Wait!

356
00:30:21,678 --> 00:30:23,088
Wait.

357
00:30:26,516 --> 00:30:29,386
Her Highness commands you
to take her handmaiden with you.

358
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:33,267
No more commands
from Her Highness today, Captain.

359
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:35,474
The spaceport
is not going to be pleasant.

360
00:30:35,609 --> 00:30:37,732
The queen wishes it.

361
00:30:37,861 --> 00:30:39,770
She's curious about the planet.

362
00:30:42,366 --> 00:30:45,402
This is not a good idea.
Stay close to me.

363
00:30:59,217 --> 00:31:02,052
Moisture farms,
for the most part.

364
00:31:03,346 --> 00:31:07,046
Some indigenous tribes
and scavengers.

365
00:31:07,183 --> 00:31:09,056
The few spaceports like this one...

366
00:31:09,185 --> 00:31:11,473
are havens for those
that don't wish to be found.

367
00:31:11,604 --> 00:31:13,513
Like us.

368
00:31:14,858 --> 00:31:17,645
Dissen berry, berry bad.

369
00:31:19,029 --> 00:31:20,737
Icky, icky goo!

370
00:31:33,752 --> 00:31:36,159
We'll try one of the smaller dealers.

371
00:31:41,886 --> 00:31:43,759
Good day to you.

372
00:31:45,431 --> 00:31:46,806
What do you want?

373
00:31:46,933 --> 00:31:50,017
I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.

374
00:31:50,144 --> 00:31:54,188
Ah, yes! Nubian.
We have lots of that.

375
00:31:54,941 --> 00:31:56,814
Boy, get in here now!

376
00:31:56,943 --> 00:31:58,816
My droid has a readout of what I need.

377
00:32:01,448 --> 00:32:03,108
What took you so long?

378
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,325
I was cleaning the fan switches.

379
00:32:05,452 --> 00:32:08,203
Watch the store.
I've got some selling to do.

380
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:11,580
So, let me take thee out back, huh?

381
00:32:11,708 --> 00:32:13,581
We'll find what you need.

382
00:32:16,088 --> 00:32:17,796
Don't touch anything.

383
00:32:28,142 --> 00:32:31,012
- Are you an angel?
- What?

384
00:32:31,145 --> 00:32:34,845
An angel. I heard the deep space
pilots talk about them.

385
00:32:34,982 --> 00:32:37,852
They're the most beautiful
creatures in the universe.

386
00:32:37,985 --> 00:32:40,558
They live on the moons of lego,
I think.

387
00:32:41,364 --> 00:32:45,029
You're a funny little boy.
How do you know so much?

388
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:48,991
I listen to all the traders
and star pilots who come through here.

389
00:32:49,122 --> 00:32:53,416
I'm a pilot, you know, and someday
I'm gonna fly away from this place.

390
00:32:53,543 --> 00:32:57,492
- You're a pilot?
- Mm-hmm. All my life.

391
00:32:57,631 --> 00:32:59,919
How long have you been here?

392
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:04,047
Since I was very little.
Three, I think.

393
00:33:04,179 --> 00:33:06,883
My mom and I were sold
to Gardulla the Hutt...

394
00:33:07,015 --> 00:33:09,719
but she lost us
betting on the Podraces.

395
00:33:09,852 --> 00:33:11,643
You're a slave?

396
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:15,898
- I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.
- I'm sorry.

397
00:33:16,025 --> 00:33:19,773
I don't fully understand.
This is a strange place to me.

398
00:33:32,208 --> 00:33:33,750
- I got ya.
- Hey!

399
00:33:33,876 --> 00:33:35,619
Hit the nose.

400
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,834
A T-14 hyperdrive generator.
Thee in luck.

401
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:46,591
I'm the only one hereabouts
who has one.

402
00:33:46,723 --> 00:33:50,222
But thee might as well buy a new ship.
It would be cheaper, I think, huh.

403
00:33:51,895 --> 00:33:53,270
Saying of which...

404
00:33:53,397 --> 00:33:55,769
how's thee gonna pay
for all this, huh?

405
00:33:55,899 --> 00:33:57,938
I have 20,000 Republic dataries.

406
00:33:58,068 --> 00:33:59,894
Republic credits?

407
00:34:00,029 --> 00:34:02,946
Republic credits are no good out here.
I need something more real.

408
00:34:03,073 --> 00:34:06,192
I don't have anything else,
but credits will do fine.

409
00:34:06,327 --> 00:34:09,945
- No, they won't.
- Credits will do fine.

410
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:11,907
No, they won't!

411
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:16,204
What, you think you're some kind of Jedi,
waving your hand around like that?

412
00:34:16,337 --> 00:34:20,584
I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks
don't work on me. Only money.

413
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:24,795
No money, no parts, no deal.

414
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:29,472
And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,
I promise you that.

415
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:40,605
Wouldn't have lasted long anyways
if I wasn't so good at building things.

416
00:34:44,366 --> 00:34:46,239
We're leaving. Jar Jar.

417
00:34:48,871 --> 00:34:51,409
I'm glad to have met you, Anakin.

418
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,366
I was glad to meet you too.

419
00:35:01,759 --> 00:35:06,302
Outlanders.
They think we know nothing.

420
00:35:06,431 --> 00:35:08,340
They seemed nice to me.

421
00:35:08,474 --> 00:35:10,383
Clean the racks.

422
00:35:10,518 --> 00:35:11,846
Then you can go home.

423
00:35:11,978 --> 00:35:13,769
Yippee!

424
00:35:19,819 --> 00:35:22,191
And you're sure there's
nothing left on board?

425
00:35:22,322 --> 00:35:24,195
A few containers of supplies.

426
00:35:24,324 --> 00:35:27,360
The queen's wardrobe, maybe,
but not enough for you to barter with...

427
00:35:27,494 --> 00:35:29,819
not in the amount
you're talking about.

428
00:35:29,955 --> 00:35:32,872
All right. I'm sure
another solution will present itself.

429
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,375
I'll check back later.

430
00:35:35,169 --> 00:35:36,829
Noah gain. Noah gain.

431
00:35:36,962 --> 00:35:39,797
Da beings hereabouts, cawazy!

432
00:35:39,923 --> 00:35:42,378
Wesa be wobbed un crunched.

433
00:35:42,509 --> 00:35:45,675
Not likely. We have nothing of value.
That's our problem.

434
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:02,355
Are you going to pay for that?

435
00:36:04,365 --> 00:36:06,238
It costs seven wupiupi.

436
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,868
Oops.

437
00:36:17,379 --> 00:36:19,252
Is this yours?

438
00:36:19,381 --> 00:36:21,124
Who, mesa-

439
00:36:25,304 --> 00:36:27,427
Careful, Sebulba.

440
00:36:27,556 --> 00:36:29,548
He's a big-time outlander.

441
00:36:29,683 --> 00:36:33,217
I'd hate to see you diced
before we race again.

442
00:36:33,354 --> 00:36:37,221
Next time we race, boy,
it will be the end of you.

443
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:40,394
If you weren't a slave,
I'd squash you now.

444
00:36:41,112 --> 00:36:43,947
Yeah, it'd be a pity
if you had to pay for me.

445
00:36:45,074 --> 00:36:48,193
- Hi.
- Hi there.

446
00:36:48,328 --> 00:36:50,119
Your buddy here was
about to be turned into orange goo.

447
00:36:50,246 --> 00:36:52,119
He picked a fight with a Dug...

448
00:36:52,248 --> 00:36:54,739
an especially dangerous Dug
called Sebulba.

449
00:36:54,876 --> 00:36:58,458
Mesa haten crunchen.
Das da las ting mesa want.

450
00:36:58,588 --> 00:37:02,585
Nevertheless, the boy is right.
You were heading into trouble.

451
00:37:03,135 --> 00:37:04,593
Thanks, my young friend.

452
00:37:06,888 --> 00:37:08,761
But mesa doen nutten!

453
00:37:17,274 --> 00:37:19,847
This storm will slow them down.

454
00:37:19,985 --> 00:37:21,479
Looks pretty bad.

455
00:37:22,822 --> 00:37:25,313
- Panaka.
- Receiving a message from home.

456
00:37:25,449 --> 00:37:27,240
We'll be right there.

457
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:35,824
Here, you'll like these pallies.

458
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,533
- Here.
- Thank you.

459
00:37:39,714 --> 00:37:42,002
My bones are aching.

460
00:37:42,133 --> 00:37:46,676
Storm's coming up, Ani.
You better get home quick.

461
00:37:46,805 --> 00:37:49,640
- Do you have shelter?
- We'll head back to our ship.

462
00:37:49,766 --> 00:37:52,339
- Is it far?
- It's on the outskirts.

463
00:37:52,477 --> 00:37:54,849
You'll never reach
the outskirts in time.

464
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:58,847
Sandstorms are very, very dangerous.

465
00:37:58,984 --> 00:38:01,439
Come on.
I'll take you to my place.

466
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,366
Mom!

467
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:21,203
- Mom, I'm home!
- Ah, dissen cosy.

468
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,712
- These are my friends, Mom.
- Hello.

469
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:27,377
- I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.
- I'm building a droid. You wanna see?

470
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,885
Your son was kind enough
to offer us shelter.

471
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,973
Come on. I'll show you 3PO.

472
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:45,028
Isn't he great?
He's not finished yet.

473
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:46,437
He's wonderful.

474
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:49,409
You really like him?

475
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:52,453
He's a protocol droid
to help Mom. Watch.

476
00:38:56,877 --> 00:38:58,157
Where is everybody?

477
00:38:58,295 --> 00:38:59,457
Whoops.

478
00:39:02,675 --> 00:39:03,837
Oh, hello.

479
00:39:03,968 --> 00:39:07,253
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

480
00:39:07,388 --> 00:39:09,261
How might I serve you?

481
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:12,177
- He's perfect.
- Oh. Perfect.

482
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:15,844
When the storm is over, I'll show you
my racer. I'm building a Podracer.

483
00:39:17,232 --> 00:39:19,770
I'm not sure this floor
is entirely stable.

484
00:39:19,901 --> 00:39:23,104
Hello. I don't believe
we have been introduced.

485
00:39:25,031 --> 00:39:27,272
R2-D2.
A pleasure to meet you.

486
00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:30,445
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

487
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:36,284
I beg your pardon,
but what do you mean, "naked"?

488
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:41,211
My parts are showing?
My goodness!

489
00:39:45,845 --> 00:39:48,300
The death toll is catastrophic.

490
00:39:48,431 --> 00:39:50,803
We must bow to their wishes.

491
00:39:50,933 --> 00:39:52,972
You must contact me.

492
00:39:53,102 --> 00:39:55,771
It's a trick.
Send no reply.

493
00:39:55,897 --> 00:39:57,889
Send no transmissions of any kind.

494
00:40:00,193 --> 00:40:03,063
It sounds like bait
to establish a connection trace.

495
00:40:03,196 --> 00:40:07,145
What if it is true,
and the people are dying?

496
00:40:07,283 --> 00:40:09,738
Either way,
we're running out of time.

497
00:40:23,383 --> 00:40:25,506
Tatooine is sparsely populated.

498
00:40:25,636 --> 00:40:28,423
If the trace was correct,
I will find them quickly, Master.

499
00:40:28,555 --> 00:40:30,428
Move against the Jedi first.

500
00:40:30,557 --> 00:40:33,261
You will then have no difficulty
in taking the queen to Naboo...

501
00:40:33,394 --> 00:40:35,267
to sign the treaty.

502
00:40:35,396 --> 00:40:37,554
At last we will reveal ourselves
to the Jedi.

503
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:40,097
At last we will have revenge.

504
00:40:40,234 --> 00:40:43,104
You have been well-trained,
my young apprentice.

505
00:40:43,237 --> 00:40:45,609
They will be no match for you.

506
00:40:50,495 --> 00:40:54,492
All slaves have a transmitter
placed inside their bodies somewhere.

507
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:58,584
I've been working on a scanner
to try and locate mine.

508
00:40:58,712 --> 00:41:02,211
- Any attempt to escape-
- And they blow you up!

509
00:41:03,133 --> 00:41:04,710
How wude!

510
00:41:04,843 --> 00:41:07,250
I can't believe
there's still slavery in the galaxy.

511
00:41:07,387 --> 00:41:09,260
The Republic's antislavery laws-

512
00:41:09,389 --> 00:41:11,714
The Republic doesn't exist out here.

513
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:14,008
We must survive on our own.

514
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,514
Xcuse me.

515
00:41:18,607 --> 00:41:21,145
Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?

516
00:41:21,277 --> 00:41:23,068
They have Podracing
on Malastare.

517
00:41:23,195 --> 00:41:25,899
Very fast, very dangerous.

518
00:41:26,699 --> 00:41:28,572
I'm the only human who can do it.

519
00:41:28,701 --> 00:41:31,702
You must have Jedi reflexes
if you race pods.

520
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:34,205
Don't do that again.

521
00:41:39,671 --> 00:41:42,244
You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?

522
00:41:45,218 --> 00:41:48,088
- What makes you think that?
- I saw your laser sword.

523
00:41:48,221 --> 00:41:51,091
Only Jedis carry
that kind of weapon.

524
00:41:51,224 --> 00:41:54,343
Perhaps I killed a Jedi
and took it from him.

525
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:56,102
I don't think so.

526
00:41:56,229 --> 00:41:58,387
No one can kill a Jedi.

527
00:41:59,232 --> 00:42:01,271
I wish that were so.

528
00:42:01,401 --> 00:42:03,440
I had a dream I was a Jedi.

529
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:06,736
I came back here
and freed all the slaves.

530
00:42:06,865 --> 00:42:10,198
- Have you come to free us?
- No, I'm afraid not.

531
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:14,656
I think you have.
Why else would you be here?

532
00:42:19,545 --> 00:42:22,296
I can see there's
no fooling you, Anakin.

533
00:42:22,423 --> 00:42:25,424
We're on our way to Coruscant,
the central system in the Republic...

534
00:42:25,551 --> 00:42:27,543
on a very important mission.

535
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:30,715
How did you end up out here
in the outer rim?

536
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:34,466
Our ship was damaged, and we're
stranded here until we can repair it.

537
00:42:35,729 --> 00:42:38,932
I can help.
I can fix anything.

538
00:42:39,065 --> 00:42:40,559
I believe you can.

539
00:42:40,692 --> 00:42:43,479
But first we must acquire
the parts we need.

540
00:42:43,612 --> 00:42:46,316
Wit no-nutten mula to trade.

541
00:42:46,448 --> 00:42:49,982
These junk dealers
must have a weakness of some kind.

542
00:42:50,118 --> 00:42:54,412
Gambling. Everything here revolves
around betting on those awful races.

543
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:55,785
Podracing.

544
00:42:55,916 --> 00:42:58,833
Greed can be a powerful ally.

545
00:42:58,961 --> 00:43:01,831
I built a racer.
It's the fastest ever.

546
00:43:01,964 --> 00:43:04,252
There's a big race tomorrow
on Boonta Eve.

547
00:43:04,383 --> 00:43:06,340
You could enter my pod.

548
00:43:07,303 --> 00:43:10,339
- Anakin, Watto won't let you.
- Watto doesn't know I've built it.

549
00:43:10,473 --> 00:43:12,346
You could make him think
it was yours...

550
00:43:12,475 --> 00:43:14,681
and get him
to let me pilot it for you.

551
00:43:14,811 --> 00:43:16,388
I don't want you to race.
It's awful.

552
00:43:16,521 --> 00:43:19,012
I die every time
Watto makes you do it.

553
00:43:19,148 --> 00:43:21,271
But, Mom, I love it.

554
00:43:21,401 --> 00:43:24,935
The prize money would more than pay
for the parts they need.

555
00:43:25,071 --> 00:43:27,359
Anakin.

556
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:30,241
Your mother's right.

557
00:43:30,368 --> 00:43:33,452
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic
who can help us?

558
00:43:34,956 --> 00:43:36,616
No.

559
00:43:41,713 --> 00:43:46,339
Mom, you say the biggest problem in this
universe is nobody helps each other.

560
00:43:51,182 --> 00:43:54,052
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want
to put your son in danger.

561
00:43:54,185 --> 00:43:56,094
We'll find some other way.

562
00:43:58,564 --> 00:44:01,019
There is no other way.

563
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:05,479
I may not like it,
but he can help you.

564
00:44:06,364 --> 00:44:08,237
He was meant to help you.

565
00:44:21,797 --> 00:44:23,670
Are you sure about this?

566
00:44:23,799 --> 00:44:26,420
Trusting our fate
to a boy we hardly know?

567
00:44:26,551 --> 00:44:28,590
The queen will not approve.

568
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,593
The queen doesn't need to know.

569
00:44:31,724 --> 00:44:33,348
Well, I don't approve.

570
00:44:34,476 --> 00:44:37,097
The boy tells me you want
to sponsor him in the race.

571
00:44:37,229 --> 00:44:38,853
How can you do this?

572
00:44:38,981 --> 00:44:42,266
Not on the Republic credits,
I think.

573
00:44:42,401 --> 00:44:44,559
My ship will be the entry fee.

574
00:44:45,071 --> 00:44:46,779
Not bad!

575
00:44:46,906 --> 00:44:49,860
Not bad, huh?
Nubian, huh?

576
00:44:49,992 --> 00:44:53,277
It's in good order,
except for the parts I need.

577
00:44:53,413 --> 00:44:55,904
What would the boy ride?

578
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,574
He smashed up my pod in the last race.
It would take some long time to fix it.

579
00:44:59,711 --> 00:45:02,036
It wasn't my fault.
Really.

580
00:45:02,172 --> 00:45:03,796
Sebulba flashed me with his vents.

581
00:45:03,923 --> 00:45:07,292
I actually saved the pod, mostly.

582
00:45:08,428 --> 00:45:10,883
That you did.

583
00:45:11,014 --> 00:45:13,801
The boy's good.
No doubts there, huh?

584
00:45:13,934 --> 00:45:16,425
I have acquired a pod
in a game of chance.

585
00:45:16,562 --> 00:45:18,222
The fastest ever built.

586
00:45:18,355 --> 00:45:23,480
I hope you didn't kill
anyone I know for it, huh?

587
00:45:25,446 --> 00:45:28,980
So, you supply the pod
and the entry fee...

588
00:45:29,116 --> 00:45:30,491
and I supply the boy.

589
00:45:30,618 --> 00:45:34,485
We split the winnings 50-50,
I think, huh?

590
00:45:34,622 --> 00:45:36,495
If it's going to be 50-50...

591
00:45:36,624 --> 00:45:39,245
I suggest you front the cash
for the entry.

592
00:45:39,377 --> 00:45:41,416
If we win...

593
00:45:41,546 --> 00:45:45,330
you keep all the winnings,
minus the cost of the parts I need.

594
00:45:45,466 --> 00:45:48,669
And if we lose,
you keep my ship.

595
00:45:51,139 --> 00:45:52,549
Either way, you win.

596
00:45:58,355 --> 00:45:59,683
Deal!

597
00:46:04,903 --> 00:46:09,150
Your friend
is a foolish one, methinks.

598
00:46:17,124 --> 00:46:20,041
What if this plan fails, Master?

599
00:46:20,169 --> 00:46:22,873
We could be stuck here
a very long time.

600
00:46:23,005 --> 00:46:25,543
Well, it's too dangerous
to call for help...

601
00:46:25,675 --> 00:46:29,044
and a ship without a power supply
isn't going to get us anywhere.

602
00:46:29,178 --> 00:46:31,135
And...

603
00:46:31,264 --> 00:46:33,137
there's something about this boy.

604
00:46:39,981 --> 00:46:42,306
You should be very proud of your son.

605
00:46:43,068 --> 00:46:45,393
He gives without any thought
of reward.

606
00:46:45,529 --> 00:46:48,399
He knows nothing of greed.

607
00:46:48,532 --> 00:46:49,611
He has-

608
00:46:50,617 --> 00:46:52,490
He has special powers.

609
00:46:54,288 --> 00:46:55,486
Yes.

610
00:46:55,622 --> 00:46:58,243
He can see things
before they happen.

611
00:46:58,375 --> 00:47:01,162
That's why he appears
to have such quick reflexes.

612
00:47:01,295 --> 00:47:03,168
It's a Jedi trait.

613
00:47:03,297 --> 00:47:06,084
He deserves better
than a slave's life.

614
00:47:06,217 --> 00:47:09,586
Had he been born in the Republic,
we would have identified him early.

615
00:47:12,014 --> 00:47:15,762
The Force is unusually strong with him.
That much is clear.

616
00:47:15,893 --> 00:47:17,636
Who was his father?

617
00:47:20,356 --> 00:47:22,265
There was no father.

618
00:47:23,735 --> 00:47:27,068
I carried him,
I gave birth, I raised him.

619
00:47:27,947 --> 00:47:30,438
I can't explain what happened.

620
00:47:32,118 --> 00:47:33,909
Can you help him?

621
00:47:34,037 --> 00:47:35,910
I don't know.

622
00:47:38,417 --> 00:47:42,035
I didn't actually come here
to free slaves.

623
00:47:55,184 --> 00:47:57,057
Wow, a real astro droid!

624
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:02,728
- How do you get so lucky?
- That isn't the half of it.

625
00:48:02,859 --> 00:48:05,813
- I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.
- What?

626
00:48:05,945 --> 00:48:07,653
With this?

627
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:10,531
You're such a joker, Ani.

628
00:48:10,658 --> 00:48:13,861
- You've been working on that for years.
- It's never gonna run.

629
00:48:13,995 --> 00:48:16,153
Come on.
Let's go and play ball.

630
00:48:16,289 --> 00:48:19,574
Keep racing, Ani.
You're gonna be bug squash.

631
00:48:28,135 --> 00:48:30,507
Keep away from
those energy binders.

632
00:48:30,637 --> 00:48:34,088
If your hand gets caught in the beam,
it's gonna go numb for hours.

633
00:48:34,224 --> 00:48:35,599
Okay.

634
00:48:39,313 --> 00:48:41,851
My tongue is fat.

635
00:48:41,982 --> 00:48:45,066
My tongue- Wrench.

636
00:48:45,194 --> 00:48:47,863
Where is de wrench?
Oh, dare it is.

637
00:48:52,326 --> 00:48:53,868
I'm stuck.

638
00:48:53,995 --> 00:48:57,992
You know, I find that Jar Jar creature
to be a little odd.

639
00:48:59,834 --> 00:49:02,669
You don't even know
if this thing's gonna run.

640
00:49:02,796 --> 00:49:04,872
- It will.
- I think it's time we found out.

641
00:49:05,006 --> 00:49:07,212
- Here, use this power charge.
- Yes, sir!

642
00:49:07,342 --> 00:49:09,381
Come on, Kitster.
Let's move away.

643
00:49:09,511 --> 00:49:11,717
My mouth.

644
00:49:11,847 --> 00:49:13,175
Ani, I'm stuck.

645
00:49:18,395 --> 00:49:20,553
My tongue is fat.

646
00:49:20,689 --> 00:49:23,643
You're quite right.
He's very odd indeed.

647
00:49:25,861 --> 00:49:27,900
Thank you.

648
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:29,440
Go.

649
00:49:43,963 --> 00:49:47,581
It's working!
It's working!

650
00:49:58,228 --> 00:50:00,719
Stay still, Ani.
Let me clean this cut.

651
00:50:00,856 --> 00:50:04,770
There's so many.
Do they all have a system of planets?

652
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:06,774
Most of them.

653
00:50:06,903 --> 00:50:08,860
Has anyone been to 'em all?

654
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:11,772
Not likely.

655
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:15,116
I wanna be the first one
to see 'em all.

656
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:18,702
Ani, bedtime!

657
00:50:18,833 --> 00:50:21,584
There we are.
Good as new.

658
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:24,580
Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again.

659
00:50:24,714 --> 00:50:28,130
- What are you doing?
- Checking your blood for infections.

660
00:50:28,259 --> 00:50:29,801
Go on.

661
00:50:29,927 --> 00:50:31,884
You have a big day tomorrow.

662
00:50:32,013 --> 00:50:33,886
Sleep well, Ani.

663
00:50:36,643 --> 00:50:38,635
- Obi-Wan?
- Yes, Master?

664
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:41,474
I need an analysis
of this blood sample I'm sending you.

665
00:50:41,606 --> 00:50:43,314
Wait a minute.

666
00:50:45,026 --> 00:50:46,983
I need a midi-chlorian count.

667
00:50:49,948 --> 00:50:52,569
The reading is off the chart.

668
00:50:52,701 --> 00:50:54,574
Over 20,000.

669
00:50:54,703 --> 00:50:58,321
Even Master Yoda doesn't have
a midi-chlorian count that high.

670
00:50:58,457 --> 00:51:00,248
No Jedi has.

671
00:51:00,375 --> 00:51:02,414
What does that mean?

672
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,919
I'm not sure.

673
00:52:14,869 --> 00:52:17,739
I wanna see your spaceship
the moment the race is over.

674
00:52:17,872 --> 00:52:19,615
Patience, my blue friend.

675
00:52:19,749 --> 00:52:21,990
You'll have your winnings
before the suns set.

676
00:52:22,127 --> 00:52:23,918
And we'll be far away from here.

677
00:52:24,045 --> 00:52:28,089
Not if your ship belongs to me,
I think, huh?

678
00:52:28,216 --> 00:52:31,585
I warn you, no funny business.

679
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,839
- You don't think Anakin can win?
- Don't get me wrongo.

680
00:52:34,973 --> 00:52:37,428
I have great faith in the boy.

681
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:39,682
He's a credit to your race...

682
00:52:39,812 --> 00:52:43,015
but Sebulba there
is going to win, I think.

683
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:46,893
Oh, no!

684
00:52:51,073 --> 00:52:52,899
Why do you think that?

685
00:52:53,034 --> 00:52:54,907
He always wins!

686
00:52:56,913 --> 00:52:59,368
I am betting heavily on Sebulba.

687
00:53:01,209 --> 00:53:03,913
- I'll take that bet.
- What?

688
00:53:04,671 --> 00:53:08,004
I'll wager my new racing pod
against, say...

689
00:53:08,133 --> 00:53:10,006
the boy and his mother.

690
00:53:10,135 --> 00:53:13,835
No pod is worth two slaves,
not by a long shot.

691
00:53:14,764 --> 00:53:16,507
The boy, then.

692
00:53:22,731 --> 00:53:25,222
We'll let fate decide, huh?

693
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:28,775
I just happen to have
a chance cube here.

694
00:53:28,904 --> 00:53:31,940
Blue, it's the boy.

695
00:53:32,074 --> 00:53:33,188
Red...

696
00:53:34,618 --> 00:53:36,242
his mother.

697
00:53:45,963 --> 00:53:48,370
You won this small toss,
outlander...

698
00:53:48,508 --> 00:53:50,631
but you won't win the race!

699
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,836
So it makes little difference!

700
00:54:02,647 --> 00:54:07,558
Better stop your friend's betting
or I'll end up owning him too.

701
00:54:11,323 --> 00:54:13,814
- What'd he mean by that?
- I'll tell you later.

702
00:54:13,951 --> 00:54:15,326
Good morning.

703
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:20,205
Oh, my.
Space travel sounds rather perilous.

704
00:54:22,293 --> 00:54:26,290
I can assure you, they will never get me
onto one of those dreadful starships.

705
00:54:26,422 --> 00:54:29,791
This is so wizard, Ani.
I'm sure you'll do it this time.

706
00:54:29,926 --> 00:54:31,005
Do what?

707
00:54:31,135 --> 00:54:34,171
Finish the race, of course.

708
00:54:34,305 --> 00:54:36,048
You've never won a race?

709
00:54:36,182 --> 00:54:38,886
Well, not exactly.

710
00:54:39,018 --> 00:54:41,010
Not even finished?

711
00:54:41,145 --> 00:54:43,600
Kitster's right.
I will this time.

712
00:54:43,731 --> 00:54:45,770
Of course you will.

713
00:55:15,431 --> 00:55:17,257
That's absolutely right.

714
00:55:17,391 --> 00:55:22,432
And a big turnout here from all corners
of the outer rim territories.

715
00:55:22,563 --> 00:55:26,181
I see the contestants are making
their way out onto the starting grid.

716
00:55:28,278 --> 00:55:31,113
I see Ben Quadinaros
from the Tund System.

717
00:55:36,786 --> 00:55:39,241
Two-time winner Boles Roor.

718
00:55:41,792 --> 00:55:43,583
Sebulba!

719
00:55:54,012 --> 00:55:57,096
And in the front row,
nearside pole position...

720
00:55:57,224 --> 00:55:59,216
Mawhonic!

721
00:56:00,436 --> 00:56:02,475
A hearty hello...

722
00:56:02,605 --> 00:56:06,305
to Clegg Holdfast
and his Voltec KT9 Wasp!

723
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:12,321
And back again,
it's the mighty Dud Bolt...

724
00:56:12,448 --> 00:56:17,026
with that incredible racing machine,
the Vulptereen 327.

725
00:56:20,373 --> 00:56:22,661
And hoping for a big win today...

726
00:56:22,792 --> 00:56:27,204
Ody Mandrell,
with his record-setting pit droid team.

727
00:56:32,094 --> 00:56:35,344
And a late entry,
young Anakin Skywalker...

728
00:56:35,472 --> 00:56:36,752
a local boy.

729
00:56:39,476 --> 00:56:41,717
I see the flags are moving
out onto the track.

730
00:57:01,958 --> 00:57:03,500
Be safe.

731
00:57:03,626 --> 00:57:05,951
I will, Mom. I promise.

732
00:57:22,145 --> 00:57:24,814
You won't walk away from this one...

733
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:27,181
you slave scum.

734
00:57:27,317 --> 00:57:30,567
Don't count on it, slime ball.

735
00:57:30,696 --> 00:57:33,068
You're bantha fodder!

736
00:57:37,661 --> 00:57:39,867
- You all set, Ani?
- Yep.

737
00:57:39,997 --> 00:57:41,621
Right.

738
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:48,374
Remember, concentrate
on the moment.

739
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:52,254
Feel, don't think.
Use your instincts.

740
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:54,009
I will.

741
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,343
May the Force be with you.

742
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,307
Jabba the Hutt.

743
00:58:17,536 --> 00:58:21,948
Welcome.

744
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:26,166
Begin the race!

745
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:39,888
Hey, looks like
they're clearing the grid.

746
00:58:41,102 --> 00:58:42,975
- Is he nervous?
- He's fine.

747
00:58:44,606 --> 00:58:47,476
You Jedi are far too reckless.
The queen is not-

748
00:58:47,609 --> 00:58:50,479
The queen trusts my judgment,
young handmaiden.

749
00:58:50,612 --> 00:58:52,818
You should too.

750
00:58:52,948 --> 00:58:55,024
You assume too much.

751
00:58:55,784 --> 00:58:58,191
Start your engines.

752
00:59:37,494 --> 00:59:40,827
Oh, dissen gonna be messy.
Me no watch'n!

753
01:00:00,851 --> 01:00:02,131
Oh, no!

754
01:00:07,775 --> 01:00:11,060
Wait.
Little Skywalker has stalled.

755
01:00:21,539 --> 01:00:25,750
It looks like Quadinaros
is having engine trouble also.

756
01:00:27,337 --> 01:00:28,617
Come on, Ani!

757
01:00:35,053 --> 01:00:36,630
And there goes Skywalker!

758
01:00:36,763 --> 01:00:38,221
Go, Ani, go!

759
01:00:38,348 --> 01:00:40,471
He will be hard-pressed
to catch up with the leaders.

760
01:01:54,594 --> 01:01:57,511
Looks like a few Tusken Raiders
are camped out...

761
01:01:57,639 --> 01:01:59,927
on the canyon dune turn.

762
01:02:11,153 --> 01:02:14,853
There goes Quadinaros'
power coupling.

763
01:02:42,602 --> 01:02:44,808
Oh, no!

764
01:02:49,609 --> 01:02:51,482
Where is Master Anakin?

765
01:02:54,739 --> 01:02:56,945
Look. Here he comes.

766
01:02:59,828 --> 01:03:02,153
It looks like Skywalker
is moving up in the field.

767
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,450
Yay! Yippee!

768
01:03:11,965 --> 01:03:15,547
He has to complete
two more circuits? Oh, dear.

769
01:04:23,164 --> 01:04:25,037
Skywalker's
spinning out of control!

770
01:05:22,976 --> 01:05:26,925
I don't care what universe you're from.
That's gotta hurt!

771
01:05:33,987 --> 01:05:35,695
Here he comes!

772
01:05:35,823 --> 01:05:38,942
At the start of the third and final lap,
Sebulba's in the lead...

773
01:05:39,076 --> 01:05:41,567
followed closely by Skywalker!

774
01:05:41,704 --> 01:05:42,569
Go, Ani!

775
01:06:09,608 --> 01:06:11,933
Skywalker's been forced
onto the service ramp!

776
01:06:33,632 --> 01:06:35,007
It's Skywalker!

777
01:06:35,968 --> 01:06:37,296
Sebulba!

778
01:06:37,428 --> 01:06:41,675
Amazing! A quick control thrust,
and he's back on course!

779
01:06:41,807 --> 01:06:43,550
Did he crash-ed?

780
01:07:24,518 --> 01:07:27,721
Skywalker's in trouble!
Sebulba takes the lead!

781
01:08:20,743 --> 01:08:22,403
He's catching Sebulba!

782
01:08:23,538 --> 01:08:26,029
Careful, Ani. Careful, Ani!

783
01:08:56,405 --> 01:08:58,777
That little human being
is out of his mind!

784
01:08:59,909 --> 01:09:01,071
They're side by side!

785
01:09:29,731 --> 01:09:31,604
- Yippee!
- Yay!

786
01:09:35,821 --> 01:09:37,529
I can't believe it.

787
01:09:37,656 --> 01:09:39,565
The crowds are going nuts!

788
01:09:48,501 --> 01:09:50,540
Yay, Ani!

789
01:09:51,879 --> 01:09:54,915
Mom, I did it! Yay!

790
01:10:05,435 --> 01:10:07,308
Good going, Ani!

791
01:10:11,691 --> 01:10:13,648
We owe you everything, Ani.

792
01:10:16,279 --> 01:10:18,402
It's so wonderful, Ani.

793
01:10:18,532 --> 01:10:21,236
You have brought hope
to those who have none.

794
01:10:21,368 --> 01:10:23,574
I'm so very proud of you.

795
01:10:34,048 --> 01:10:35,921
You!

796
01:10:36,050 --> 01:10:38,338
You swindled me.

797
01:10:38,469 --> 01:10:42,253
You knew the boy was going to win.
Somehow you knew it.

798
01:10:42,390 --> 01:10:44,263
I lost everything.

799
01:10:44,392 --> 01:10:47,926
Whenever you gamble, my friend,
eventually you lose.

800
01:10:48,062 --> 01:10:50,517
Bring the parts
to the main hangar.

801
01:10:50,648 --> 01:10:53,732
I'll come by your shop later on
so you can release the boy.

802
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:57,145
You can't have him.
It wasn't a fair bet.

803
01:10:59,908 --> 01:11:03,359
Would you like to discuss it
with the Hutts?

804
01:11:03,495 --> 01:11:05,986
I'm sure they can settle this.

805
01:11:07,499 --> 01:11:09,372
Take him.

806
01:11:16,341 --> 01:11:17,372
Hidoe!

807
01:11:19,011 --> 01:11:21,087
Well, we have all
the essential parts we need.

808
01:11:21,221 --> 01:11:22,252
I'm going back.

809
01:11:22,389 --> 01:11:24,465
Some unfinished business.
I won't be long.

810
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:28,051
Why do I sense we've picked up
another pathetic life-form?

811
01:11:28,854 --> 01:11:31,973
It's the boy who's responsible
for getting us these parts.

812
01:11:32,108 --> 01:11:33,981
Get this hyperdrive
generator installed.

813
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:36,648
Yes, Master.
That shouldn't take long.

814
01:11:36,779 --> 01:11:38,937
Come on. Hup!

815
01:11:43,578 --> 01:11:45,451
Hey. These are yours.

816
01:11:47,457 --> 01:11:48,702
Yes!

817
01:11:50,251 --> 01:11:53,002
Mom, we sold the pod!
Look at all the money we have!

818
01:11:53,129 --> 01:11:55,501
My goodness!
But that's so wonderful, Ani.

819
01:11:55,632 --> 01:11:58,586
- And he has been freed.
- What?

820
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:00,510
You're no longer a slave.

821
01:12:02,431 --> 01:12:04,340
Did you hear that?

822
01:12:05,142 --> 01:12:07,597
Now you can make
your dreams come true, Ani.

823
01:12:08,479 --> 01:12:10,388
You are free.

824
01:12:13,984 --> 01:12:15,442
Will you take him with you?

825
01:12:15,569 --> 01:12:17,193
Is he to become a Jedi?

826
01:12:17,321 --> 01:12:19,859
Yes. Our meeting
was not a coincidence.

827
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,360
Nothing happens by accident.

828
01:12:22,493 --> 01:12:26,027
You mean I get to come with you
in your starship?

829
01:12:26,164 --> 01:12:27,574
Anakin...

830
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:32,785
training to become a Jedi
is not an easy challenge...

831
01:12:32,921 --> 01:12:35,791
and even if you succeed,
it's a hard life.

832
01:12:35,924 --> 01:12:39,090
But I wanna go. It's what
I've always dreamed of doing.

833
01:12:39,928 --> 01:12:42,051
Can I go, Mom?

834
01:12:43,014 --> 01:12:44,674
Anakin...

835
01:12:44,808 --> 01:12:47,725
this path has been placed
before you.

836
01:12:47,853 --> 01:12:50,308
The choice is yours alone.

837
01:12:53,984 --> 01:12:55,857
I wanna do it.

838
01:12:58,447 --> 01:13:00,653
Then pack your things.
We haven't much time.

839
01:13:07,289 --> 01:13:08,866
What about Mom?

840
01:13:12,003 --> 01:13:13,876
Is she free too?

841
01:13:14,005 --> 01:13:17,504
I tried to free your mother, Ani,
but Watto wouldn't have it.

842
01:13:18,551 --> 01:13:20,508
You're coming with us,
aren't you, Mom?

843
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:31,853
Son, my place is here.
My future is here.

844
01:13:31,982 --> 01:13:34,354
It is time for you to let go.

845
01:13:35,485 --> 01:13:37,608
I don't want things to change.

846
01:13:37,738 --> 01:13:40,110
But you can't stop the change...

847
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:43,324
any more than you can
stop the suns from setting.

848
01:13:44,411 --> 01:13:46,320
I love you.

849
01:13:52,002 --> 01:13:53,875
Now hurry.

850
01:13:59,427 --> 01:14:00,802
Thank you.

851
01:14:00,928 --> 01:14:03,845
I'll watch after him.
You have my word.

852
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:07,594
Will you be all right?

853
01:14:09,062 --> 01:14:10,520
Yeah.

854
01:14:15,568 --> 01:14:17,145
Hello, Master Anakin.

855
01:14:17,279 --> 01:14:19,355
Well, 3PO, I've been freed...

856
01:14:19,489 --> 01:14:21,861
and I'm going away in a starship.

857
01:14:21,992 --> 01:14:24,909
Master Anakin, you are my maker
and I wish you well.

858
01:14:25,037 --> 01:14:29,248
However, I should prefer it
if I were a little more completed.

859
01:14:29,374 --> 01:14:32,493
I'm sorry I wasn't able
to finish you, 3PO...

860
01:14:32,628 --> 01:14:34,667
give you coverings and all.

861
01:14:34,797 --> 01:14:36,421
I'm gonna miss working on you.

862
01:14:36,548 --> 01:14:39,003
You've been a great pal.

863
01:14:39,134 --> 01:14:41,755
I'll make sure Mom
doesn't sell you or anything.

864
01:14:42,555 --> 01:14:43,586
Sell me?

865
01:14:43,723 --> 01:14:45,347
Bye.

866
01:14:45,474 --> 01:14:46,849
Oh, my.

867
01:15:11,501 --> 01:15:13,707
I can't do it, Mom.
I just can't do it.

868
01:15:18,008 --> 01:15:20,000
Will I ever see you again?

869
01:15:21,470 --> 01:15:24,340
What does your heart tell you?

870
01:15:25,683 --> 01:15:27,592
I hope so.

871
01:15:28,352 --> 01:15:30,225
Yes.

872
01:15:30,354 --> 01:15:31,931
I guess.

873
01:15:32,982 --> 01:15:35,555
Then we will
see each other again.

874
01:15:38,279 --> 01:15:41,066
I will come back
and free you, Mom.

875
01:15:41,199 --> 01:15:42,907
I promise.

876
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:54,121
Now, be brave...

877
01:15:54,921 --> 01:15:56,913
and don't look back.

878
01:15:57,716 --> 01:15:59,589
Don't look back.

879
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:45,259
Qui-Gon, sir, wait!

880
01:16:45,390 --> 01:16:47,133
- I'm tired!
- Anakin! Drop!

881
01:16:49,603 --> 01:16:50,551
Go!

882
01:16:51,605 --> 01:16:53,514
Tell them to take off!

883
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:07,578
Qui-Gon's in trouble.

884
01:17:08,873 --> 01:17:10,248
Take off.

885
01:17:10,958 --> 01:17:12,701
Over there. Fly low.

886
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:37,317
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

887
01:17:37,444 --> 01:17:38,986
What was it?

888
01:17:39,112 --> 01:17:40,855
I'm not sure...

889
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:43,527
but it was well-trained
in the Jedi arts.

890
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:46,156
My guess is
it was after the queen.

891
01:17:46,286 --> 01:17:48,777
What are we gonna do about it?

892
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:52,373
We shall be patient.

893
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:53,615
Anakin Skywalker...

894
01:17:53,752 --> 01:17:55,543
meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.

895
01:17:57,965 --> 01:18:00,503
You're a Jedi too?
Pleased to meet you.

896
01:18:09,477 --> 01:18:12,015
Your queen is lost,
your people are starving...

897
01:18:12,146 --> 01:18:14,138
and you, Governor,
are going to die...

898
01:18:14,274 --> 01:18:16,397
much sooner than your people,
I'm afraid.

899
01:18:16,526 --> 01:18:19,017
This invasion
will gain you nothing.

900
01:18:19,154 --> 01:18:22,155
We're a democracy.
The people have decided.

901
01:18:22,282 --> 01:18:24,155
Take him away.

902
01:18:27,621 --> 01:18:30,076
My troops are in position
to begin searching the swamps...

903
01:18:30,207 --> 01:18:32,745
for these rumoured
underwater villages.

904
01:18:32,876 --> 01:18:35,497
They will not
stay hidden for long.

905
01:18:46,557 --> 01:18:49,261
The death toll is catastrophic.

906
01:18:49,393 --> 01:18:52,014
We must bow to their wishes.

907
01:18:52,146 --> 01:18:54,352
You must contact me.

908
01:19:08,496 --> 01:19:10,405
You all right?

909
01:19:11,458 --> 01:19:13,367
It's very cold.

910
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:24,094
You come from
a warm planet, Ani.

911
01:19:24,221 --> 01:19:26,593
A little too warm
for my taste.

912
01:19:26,724 --> 01:19:28,965
Space is cold.

913
01:19:29,101 --> 01:19:31,224
You seem sad.

914
01:19:32,396 --> 01:19:34,637
The queen is worried.

915
01:19:34,774 --> 01:19:37,181
Her people are suffering, dying.

916
01:19:37,318 --> 01:19:40,817
She must convince the senate
to intervene or...

917
01:19:42,281 --> 01:19:44,569
I'm not sure what'll happen.

918
01:19:46,035 --> 01:19:48,074
I made this for you...

919
01:19:49,581 --> 01:19:51,454
so you'd remember me.

920
01:19:52,167 --> 01:19:54,836
I carved it
out of a japor snippet.

921
01:19:54,961 --> 01:19:57,796
It'll bring you good fortune.

922
01:19:57,923 --> 01:19:59,796
It's beautiful.

923
01:19:59,925 --> 01:20:02,297
But I don't need this
to remember you by.

924
01:20:05,973 --> 01:20:09,342
Many things will change
when we reach the capital, Ani...

925
01:20:09,476 --> 01:20:12,014
but my caring for you will remain.

926
01:20:14,732 --> 01:20:17,851
I care for you, too, only I-

927
01:20:17,985 --> 01:20:20,143
Miss your mother.

928
01:20:38,631 --> 01:20:42,794
Coruscant.
The entire planet is one big city.

929
01:20:42,927 --> 01:20:44,670
There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle.

930
01:20:44,804 --> 01:20:48,054
And look over there.
Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.

931
01:21:17,547 --> 01:21:20,583
It is a great gift
to see you alive, Your Majesty.

932
01:21:20,716 --> 01:21:23,670
With the communications breakdown,
we've been very concerned.

933
01:21:23,803 --> 01:21:26,258
I'm anxious to hear your report
on the situation.

934
01:21:26,389 --> 01:21:29,010
May I present
Supreme Chancellor Valorum.

935
01:21:29,142 --> 01:21:31,099
Welcome, Your Highness.

936
01:21:31,227 --> 01:21:33,266
It's an honour to finally
meet you in person.

937
01:21:33,396 --> 01:21:34,854
Thank you, Supreme Chancellor.

938
01:21:34,981 --> 01:21:38,480
I must relay to you how distressed
everyone is over the current situation.

939
01:21:38,610 --> 01:21:42,026
I've called for a special session
of the senate to hear your position.

940
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:46,282
I'm grateful for your concern,
Chancellor.

941
01:21:46,410 --> 01:21:48,283
There is a question
of procedure...

942
01:21:48,412 --> 01:21:50,903
but I'm confident
we can overcome it.

943
01:21:51,749 --> 01:21:53,907
I must speak with the Jedi Council
immediately.

944
01:21:54,043 --> 01:21:56,830
The situation has become
much more complicated.

945
01:22:02,593 --> 01:22:04,502
Ani, come on.

946
01:22:15,732 --> 01:22:18,436
Da queen's a bein grossly nice,
mesa tinks.

947
01:22:19,778 --> 01:22:21,735
Pitty hot.

948
01:22:49,642 --> 01:22:52,761
There is no civility,
only politics.

949
01:22:54,063 --> 01:22:57,930
The Republic
is not what it once was.

950
01:22:58,067 --> 01:23:03,309
The senate is full of greedy,
squabbling delegates.

951
01:23:04,115 --> 01:23:07,531
There is no interest
in the common good.

952
01:23:08,411 --> 01:23:10,035
I must be frank, Your Majesty.

953
01:23:10,163 --> 01:23:12,867
There is little chance the senate
will act on the invasion.

954
01:23:12,999 --> 01:23:15,703
Chancellor Valorum
seems to think there is hope.

955
01:23:15,836 --> 01:23:17,709
If I may say so, Your Majesty...

956
01:23:17,838 --> 01:23:20,044
the chancellor
has little real power.

957
01:23:20,173 --> 01:23:24,040
He is mired by baseless
accusations of corruption.

958
01:23:24,178 --> 01:23:27,926
- The bureaucrats are in charge now.
- What options have we?

959
01:23:28,682 --> 01:23:31,552
Our best choice would be
to push for the election...

960
01:23:31,685 --> 01:23:33,891
of a stronger
supreme chancellor...

961
01:23:34,021 --> 01:23:36,179
one who could control
the bureaucrats...

962
01:23:36,315 --> 01:23:38,141
and give us justice.

963
01:23:39,026 --> 01:23:44,530
You could call for a vote of
no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.

964
01:23:44,657 --> 01:23:47,148
He has been
our strongest supporter.

965
01:23:47,285 --> 01:23:52,492
Our only other choice would be
to submit a plea to the courts.

966
01:23:52,624 --> 01:23:55,957
The courts take even longer
to decide things than the senate.

967
01:23:56,878 --> 01:23:58,954
Our people are dying, Senator.

968
01:23:59,756 --> 01:24:02,757
We must do something quickly
to stop the Federation.

969
01:24:02,884 --> 01:24:05,375
To be realistic, Your Majesty...

970
01:24:05,512 --> 01:24:08,003
I think we're going to have to
accept Federation control...

971
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:10,631
for the time being.

972
01:24:12,394 --> 01:24:14,470
That is something I cannot do.

973
01:24:21,820 --> 01:24:24,393
He was trained in the Jedi arts.

974
01:24:24,532 --> 01:24:28,446
My only conclusion can be
that it was a Sith lord.

975
01:24:28,577 --> 01:24:29,952
Impossible.

976
01:24:30,079 --> 01:24:32,748
The Sith have been extinct
for a millennium.

977
01:24:32,874 --> 01:24:37,037
I do not believe the Sith could
have returned without us knowing.

978
01:24:38,046 --> 01:24:40,252
Hard to see,
the dark side is.

979
01:24:40,381 --> 01:24:43,251
We will use all our resources
to unravel this mystery.

980
01:24:43,384 --> 01:24:46,587
We will discover the identity
of your attacker.

981
01:24:46,721 --> 01:24:48,381
May the Force be with you.

982
01:24:52,435 --> 01:24:53,893
Master Qui-Gon.

983
01:24:54,771 --> 01:24:56,562
More to say have you?

984
01:24:58,692 --> 01:25:00,565
With your permission, my master...

985
01:25:02,112 --> 01:25:05,113
I have encountered
a vergence in the Force.

986
01:25:06,241 --> 01:25:08,233
A vergence, you say.

987
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:10,492
Located around a person?

988
01:25:10,621 --> 01:25:11,866
A boy.

989
01:25:11,997 --> 01:25:14,488
His cells have the highest
concentration of midi-chlorians...

990
01:25:14,625 --> 01:25:16,416
I have seen in a life-form.

991
01:25:16,544 --> 01:25:19,414
It is possible he was conceived
by the midi-chlorians.

992
01:25:21,132 --> 01:25:24,999
You refer to the prophecy of the one
who will bring balance to the Force.

993
01:25:25,803 --> 01:25:27,926
You believe it's this boy?

994
01:25:28,056 --> 01:25:30,629
- I don't presume to-
- But you do.

995
01:25:31,392 --> 01:25:33,349
Revealed your opinion is.

996
01:25:33,478 --> 01:25:35,517
I request the boy be tested,
Master.

997
01:25:37,649 --> 01:25:40,852
Trained as a Jedi
you request for him, hmm?

998
01:25:40,986 --> 01:25:43,358
Finding him
was the will of the Force.

999
01:25:43,488 --> 01:25:45,729
I have no doubt of that.

1000
01:25:52,414 --> 01:25:54,453
Bring him before us, then.

1001
01:26:05,553 --> 01:26:07,426
The boy's here to see Padmé.

1002
01:26:07,555 --> 01:26:09,132
Let him in.

1003
01:26:12,351 --> 01:26:16,218
I'm sorry, Ani, but Padmé's
not here right now.

1004
01:26:16,356 --> 01:26:18,016
Who is it?

1005
01:26:18,816 --> 01:26:21,817
Anakin Skywalker to see Padmé,
Your Highness.

1006
01:26:21,945 --> 01:26:23,736
I've sent Padmé on an errand.

1007
01:26:23,863 --> 01:26:25,736
I'm on my way
to the Jedi temple...

1008
01:26:25,865 --> 01:26:28,106
to start my training, I hope.

1009
01:26:28,952 --> 01:26:32,784
I may never see her again,
so I came to say goodbye.

1010
01:26:33,874 --> 01:26:37,492
We will tell her for you.
We are sure her heart goes with you.

1011
01:26:38,629 --> 01:26:39,660
Thank you, Your Highness.

1012
01:26:53,686 --> 01:26:57,766
The chair recognizes the senator
from the sovereign system of Naboo.

1013
01:27:04,572 --> 01:27:07,941
Supreme Chancellor,
delegates of the senate...

1014
01:27:09,077 --> 01:27:11,449
a tragedy has occurred...

1015
01:27:11,579 --> 01:27:15,078
which started right here
with the taxation of trade routes...

1016
01:27:15,208 --> 01:27:18,209
and has now engulfed
our entire planet...

1017
01:27:18,336 --> 01:27:20,328
in the oppression
of the Trade Federation.

1018
01:27:21,214 --> 01:27:22,624
This is outrageous!

1019
01:27:22,758 --> 01:27:25,296
I object
to the senator's statements.

1020
01:27:25,427 --> 01:27:29,471
The chair does not recognize the senator
from the Trade Federation at this time.

1021
01:27:29,598 --> 01:27:33,465
To state our allegations,
I present Queen Amidala...

1022
01:27:33,602 --> 01:27:35,594
recently elected
ruler of the Naboo...

1023
01:27:35,729 --> 01:27:37,602
who speaks on our behalf.

1024
01:27:43,612 --> 01:27:46,363
Honourable representatives
of the Republic...

1025
01:27:47,116 --> 01:27:49,571
I come to you under the gravest
of circumstances.

1026
01:27:49,702 --> 01:27:52,572
The Naboo system has been invaded
by the droid armies of the Trade-

1027
01:27:52,705 --> 01:27:56,239
I object!
There is no proof!

1028
01:27:56,376 --> 01:27:58,249
This is incredible.

1029
01:27:58,378 --> 01:28:02,327
We recommend a commission be sent
to Naboo to ascertain the truth.

1030
01:28:02,465 --> 01:28:03,745
The Congress of Malastare...

1031
01:28:03,883 --> 01:28:06,884
concurs with the honourable delegate
from the Trade Federation.

1032
01:28:07,012 --> 01:28:09,051
A commission must be appointed.

1033
01:28:09,181 --> 01:28:11,672
- The point-
- Excuse me, Chancellor.

1034
01:28:11,808 --> 01:28:13,432
Enter the bureaucrat.

1035
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:16,181
The true rulers of the Republic.

1036
01:28:16,313 --> 01:28:20,476
And on the payroll
of the Trade Federation, I might add.

1037
01:28:20,609 --> 01:28:24,820
This is where Chancellor Valorum's
strength will disappear.

1038
01:28:26,407 --> 01:28:28,695
The point is conceded.

1039
01:28:28,826 --> 01:28:31,447
Will you defer your motion
to allow a commission...

1040
01:28:31,579 --> 01:28:34,366
to explore the validity
of your accusations?

1041
01:28:34,498 --> 01:28:36,371
I will not defer.

1042
01:28:36,501 --> 01:28:40,000
I've come before you to resolve
this attack on our sovereignty now.

1043
01:28:40,129 --> 01:28:43,130
I was not elected to watch
my people suffer and die...

1044
01:28:43,258 --> 01:28:45,927
while you discuss this invasion
in a committee.

1045
01:28:48,888 --> 01:28:51,213
If this body
is not capable of action...

1046
01:28:51,349 --> 01:28:53,388
I suggest new leadership is needed.

1047
01:28:56,813 --> 01:28:59,019
I move for a vote
of no confidence...

1048
01:28:59,149 --> 01:29:01,141
in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.

1049
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:10,358
Vote now! Vote now!

1050
01:29:14,164 --> 01:29:16,073
Order!

1051
01:29:16,208 --> 01:29:19,078
Now they will elect
a new chancellor...

1052
01:29:19,211 --> 01:29:21,084
a strong chancellor...

1053
01:29:21,213 --> 01:29:24,130
one who will not
let our tragedy continue.

1054
01:29:25,843 --> 01:29:30,090
The boy will not pass the council's
test, Master. He's too old.

1055
01:29:30,223 --> 01:29:33,342
Anakin will become a Jedi,
I promise you.

1056
01:29:33,476 --> 01:29:36,180
Do not defy the council,
Master, not again.

1057
01:29:36,312 --> 01:29:39,016
I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.

1058
01:29:40,942 --> 01:29:44,690
If you would just follow the code,
you would be on the council.

1059
01:29:44,821 --> 01:29:46,860
They will not go along
with you this time.

1060
01:29:48,367 --> 01:29:50,940
You still have much to learn,
my young apprentice.

1061
01:29:54,248 --> 01:29:55,623
A ship.

1062
01:29:57,251 --> 01:29:59,208
A cup.

1063
01:29:59,336 --> 01:30:01,127
A ship.

1064
01:30:02,256 --> 01:30:03,714
A speeder.

1065
01:30:11,265 --> 01:30:13,174
How feel you?

1066
01:30:13,768 --> 01:30:15,428
Cold, sir.

1067
01:30:17,105 --> 01:30:19,263
- Afraid are you?
- No, sir.

1068
01:30:20,441 --> 01:30:23,062
See through you we can.

1069
01:30:23,194 --> 01:30:25,067
Be mindful of your feelings.

1070
01:30:25,196 --> 01:30:27,947
Your thoughts dwell on your mother.

1071
01:30:29,618 --> 01:30:31,028
I miss her.

1072
01:30:32,287 --> 01:30:34,742
Afraid to lose her,
I think, mmm?

1073
01:30:34,873 --> 01:30:36,996
What has that got to do
with anything?

1074
01:30:37,125 --> 01:30:39,450
Everything.

1075
01:30:39,586 --> 01:30:42,622
Fear is the path to the dark side.

1076
01:30:42,756 --> 01:30:45,626
Fear leads to anger.
Anger leads to hate.

1077
01:30:45,759 --> 01:30:49,092
Hate leads to suffering.

1078
01:30:55,644 --> 01:30:58,561
I sense much fear in you.

1079
01:31:11,494 --> 01:31:14,863
Yousa tinking
yousa people ganna die?

1080
01:31:14,998 --> 01:31:16,326
I don't know.

1081
01:31:17,667 --> 01:31:19,540
Gungans get pasted too, eh?

1082
01:31:22,005 --> 01:31:24,044
I hope not.

1083
01:31:24,841 --> 01:31:27,047
Gungans no die'n without a fight.

1084
01:31:27,177 --> 01:31:29,050
Wesa warriors.

1085
01:31:29,179 --> 01:31:32,429
Wesa got a grand army.

1086
01:31:32,558 --> 01:31:35,761
Dat's why you no liken us,
mesa tinks.

1087
01:31:35,894 --> 01:31:37,222
Your Highness?

1088
01:31:39,899 --> 01:31:42,022
Your Highness...

1089
01:31:42,151 --> 01:31:45,235
Senator Palpatine has been nominated
to succeed Valorum...

1090
01:31:45,363 --> 01:31:46,738
as supreme chancellor.

1091
01:31:46,864 --> 01:31:50,731
A surprise, to be sure,
but a welcome one.

1092
01:31:50,868 --> 01:31:55,245
Your Majesty, if I am elected,
I promise to put an end to corruption.

1093
01:31:55,373 --> 01:31:57,033
Who else has been nominated?

1094
01:31:57,166 --> 01:32:01,460
Bail Antilles of Alderaan
and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.

1095
01:32:01,588 --> 01:32:06,499
I feel confident our situation will
create a strong sympathy vote for us.

1096
01:32:08,220 --> 01:32:10,212
I will be chancellor.

1097
01:32:10,347 --> 01:32:12,920
I fear by the time you have control
of the bureaucrats, Senator...

1098
01:32:13,058 --> 01:32:16,261
there'll be nothing left
of our people, our way of life.

1099
01:32:16,395 --> 01:32:18,268
I understand your concern,
Your Majesty.

1100
01:32:18,397 --> 01:32:21,931
Unfortunately, the Federation
has possession of our planet.

1101
01:32:23,736 --> 01:32:27,520
Senator, this is your arena.

1102
01:32:27,907 --> 01:32:29,816
I feel I must return to mine.

1103
01:32:33,079 --> 01:32:35,367
I've decided to go back to Naboo.

1104
01:32:35,498 --> 01:32:36,363
Go back?

1105
01:32:36,499 --> 01:32:39,453
But, Your Majesty, be realistic.
They'll force you to sign the treaty.

1106
01:32:39,585 --> 01:32:41,957
I will sign no treaty, Senator.

1107
01:32:42,088 --> 01:32:44,875
My fate will be no different
than that of our people.

1108
01:32:45,008 --> 01:32:46,585
- Captain.
- Your Highness.

1109
01:32:46,718 --> 01:32:49,006
- Ready my ship.
- Please, Your Majesty.

1110
01:32:49,137 --> 01:32:51,010
Stay here where it's safe.

1111
01:32:52,515 --> 01:32:55,681
It is clear to me now that
the Republic no longer functions.

1112
01:32:56,436 --> 01:33:00,564
I pray you will bring sanity
and compassion back to the senate.

1113
01:33:10,284 --> 01:33:12,857
The Force is strong with him.

1114
01:33:12,995 --> 01:33:14,904
He is to be trained, then?

1115
01:33:17,041 --> 01:33:19,413
No, he will not be trained.

1116
01:33:19,543 --> 01:33:21,203
No?

1117
01:33:23,255 --> 01:33:25,294
He is too old.

1118
01:33:25,424 --> 01:33:29,208
He is the chosen one.
You must see it.

1119
01:33:30,388 --> 01:33:33,922
Clouded this boy's future is.

1120
01:33:36,144 --> 01:33:37,970
I will train him, then.

1121
01:33:42,317 --> 01:33:45,152
I take Anakin
as my Padawan learner.

1122
01:33:45,278 --> 01:33:48,195
An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon.

1123
01:33:48,323 --> 01:33:50,695
Impossible to take on a second.

1124
01:33:50,826 --> 01:33:52,486
The code forbids it.

1125
01:33:52,619 --> 01:33:55,988
- Obi-Wan is ready.
- I am ready to face the trials.

1126
01:33:56,123 --> 01:33:59,741
Our own counsel we will keep
on who is ready.

1127
01:34:00,753 --> 01:34:03,374
He is headstrong and he has much
to learn of the living Force...

1128
01:34:03,505 --> 01:34:05,213
but he is capable.

1129
01:34:05,341 --> 01:34:07,333
There is little more
he can learn from me.

1130
01:34:09,929 --> 01:34:13,713
Young Skywalker's fate
will be decided later.

1131
01:34:13,849 --> 01:34:16,422
Now is not the time for this.

1132
01:34:17,228 --> 01:34:19,185
The senate is voting
for a new supreme chancellor...

1133
01:34:19,313 --> 01:34:21,982
and Queen Amidala
is returning home...

1134
01:34:22,108 --> 01:34:25,311
which puts pressure on the Federation
and could widen the confrontation.

1135
01:34:25,445 --> 01:34:27,733
And draw out the queen's attacker.

1136
01:34:27,864 --> 01:34:32,241
Go with the queen to Naboo and discover
the identity of this dark warrior.

1137
01:34:33,536 --> 01:34:35,078
This is the clue we need...

1138
01:34:35,205 --> 01:34:37,778
to unravel
the mystery of the Sith.

1139
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:40,706
May the Force be with you.

1140
01:34:53,891 --> 01:34:56,761
It's not disrespect, Master.
It's the truth.

1141
01:34:56,894 --> 01:34:58,767
From your point of view.

1142
01:34:58,896 --> 01:35:02,265
The boy is dangerous.
They all sense it. Why can't you?

1143
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:05,270
His fate is uncertain.
He's not dangerous.

1144
01:35:05,403 --> 01:35:07,775
The council will decide
Anakin's future.

1145
01:35:07,905 --> 01:35:10,822
That should be enough for you.
Now get on board.

1146
01:35:16,498 --> 01:35:20,246
Qui-Gon, sir,
I don't want to be a problem.

1147
01:35:20,377 --> 01:35:22,583
You won't be, Ani.

1148
01:35:22,712 --> 01:35:24,621
I'm not allowed to train you...

1149
01:35:24,756 --> 01:35:26,795
so I want you to watch me
and be mindful.

1150
01:35:26,925 --> 01:35:29,001
Always remember:

1151
01:35:29,928 --> 01:35:32,549
Your focus determines your reality.

1152
01:35:32,681 --> 01:35:36,263
Stay close to me
and you'll be safe.

1153
01:35:36,393 --> 01:35:37,768
Master, sir...

1154
01:35:37,895 --> 01:35:41,477
I heard Yoda talking
about midi-chlorians.

1155
01:35:41,607 --> 01:35:45,106
I've been wondering-
What are midi-chlorians?

1156
01:35:46,403 --> 01:35:48,775
Midi-chlorians are
a microscopic life-form...

1157
01:35:48,906 --> 01:35:51,147
that resides
within all living cells.

1158
01:35:52,618 --> 01:35:55,488
- They live inside me?
- Inside your cells, yes.

1159
01:35:55,621 --> 01:35:59,072
- And we are symbionts with them.
- Symbionts?

1160
01:35:59,208 --> 01:36:03,075
Life-forms living together
for mutual advantage.

1161
01:36:03,213 --> 01:36:06,083
Without the midi-chlorians,
life could not exist...

1162
01:36:06,216 --> 01:36:09,003
and we would have
no knowledge of the Force.

1163
01:36:09,135 --> 01:36:11,008
They continually speak to us...

1164
01:36:11,137 --> 01:36:13,806
telling us the will of the Force.

1165
01:36:13,932 --> 01:36:16,008
When you learn
to quiet your mind...

1166
01:36:16,143 --> 01:36:18,016
you'll hear them speaking to you.

1167
01:36:18,145 --> 01:36:20,018
I don't understand.

1168
01:36:20,147 --> 01:36:23,646
With time and training, Ani,
you will. You will.

1169
01:36:27,696 --> 01:36:31,444
Your Majesty, it is our pleasure
to continue to serve and protect you.

1170
01:36:32,159 --> 01:36:33,569
I welcome your help.

1171
01:36:33,702 --> 01:36:37,402
Senator Palpatine fears that
the Federation means to destroy me.

1172
01:36:37,540 --> 01:36:40,541
I assure you I will not
allow that to happen.

1173
01:36:40,668 --> 01:36:43,538
Wesa goin' home!

1174
01:36:43,671 --> 01:36:45,544
Come on, R2.

1175
01:36:55,809 --> 01:36:58,181
Is the planet secure?

1176
01:36:58,311 --> 01:37:02,178
We have taken over the last pockets
of primitive life-forms.

1177
01:37:02,315 --> 01:37:05,399
We are in complete control
of the planet now.

1178
01:37:05,527 --> 01:37:08,693
Good. I will see to it
that in the senate...

1179
01:37:08,822 --> 01:37:11,739
things stay as they are.

1180
01:37:11,867 --> 01:37:15,366
I am sending my apprentice,
Darth Maul, to join you.

1181
01:37:15,496 --> 01:37:17,369
Yes, my lord.

1182
01:37:17,498 --> 01:37:19,371
A Sith here?

1183
01:37:24,797 --> 01:37:27,252
Those are the forward stabilizers.

1184
01:37:27,383 --> 01:37:29,755
And those two control the pitch?

1185
01:37:31,345 --> 01:37:33,218
You catch on pretty quick.

1186
01:37:33,347 --> 01:37:35,090
As soon as we land...

1187
01:37:35,224 --> 01:37:37,845
the Federation will arrest you
and force you to sign the treaty.

1188
01:37:37,977 --> 01:37:39,008
I agree.

1189
01:37:39,145 --> 01:37:41,896
I'm not sure what you wish
to accomplish by this.

1190
01:37:42,023 --> 01:37:44,478
I will take back what's ours.

1191
01:37:45,276 --> 01:37:47,434
There are too few of us,
Your Highness.

1192
01:37:47,570 --> 01:37:49,443
We have no army.

1193
01:37:49,573 --> 01:37:50,948
And I can only protect you.

1194
01:37:51,074 --> 01:37:53,113
I can't fight a war for you.

1195
01:37:54,161 --> 01:37:55,192
Jar Jar Binks.

1196
01:37:56,121 --> 01:37:58,279
Mesa, Your Highness?

1197
01:37:58,415 --> 01:38:01,332
Yes. I need your help.

1198
01:38:06,590 --> 01:38:08,796
I have one battleship on my scope.

1199
01:38:08,926 --> 01:38:10,965
It's a droid control ship.

1200
01:38:11,095 --> 01:38:13,301
They've probably spotted us.

1201
01:38:13,431 --> 01:38:15,139
We haven't much time.

1202
01:38:26,861 --> 01:38:29,530
Jar Jar is on his way
to the Gungan city, Master.

1203
01:38:29,656 --> 01:38:30,936
Good.

1204
01:38:31,074 --> 01:38:33,315
Do you think
the queen's idea will work?

1205
01:38:33,451 --> 01:38:35,075
The Gungans will not
be easily swayed.

1206
01:38:37,163 --> 01:38:39,488
And we cannot use our power
to help her.

1207
01:38:41,293 --> 01:38:44,377
I'm sorry for
my behaviour, Master.

1208
01:38:44,504 --> 01:38:48,204
It's not my place to disagree
with you about the boy.

1209
01:38:50,135 --> 01:38:53,420
And I am grateful you think
I'm ready to take the trials.

1210
01:38:54,598 --> 01:38:56,471
You've been a good apprentice,
Obi-Wan.

1211
01:38:57,935 --> 01:39:00,604
And you're a much wiser man
than I am.

1212
01:39:01,313 --> 01:39:04,646
I foresee you will become
a great Jedi knight.

1213
01:39:17,664 --> 01:39:20,036
Desa nobody dare!

1214
01:39:20,166 --> 01:39:22,324
The Gungan city is deserted!

1215
01:39:22,460 --> 01:39:24,998
Some kinda fight, mesa tinks.

1216
01:39:25,130 --> 01:39:28,214
Do you think they have been taken
to the camps?

1217
01:39:28,341 --> 01:39:30,666
More likely they were wiped out.

1218
01:39:30,802 --> 01:39:33,838
- Mesa no tink so.
- Do you know where they are,Jar Jar?

1219
01:39:33,972 --> 01:39:37,388
When in trouble,
Gungans go to sacred place.

1220
01:39:37,518 --> 01:39:40,388
Mesa show you.
Come on. Mesa show you!

1221
01:39:58,748 --> 01:40:02,330
Your Honour,
Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1222
01:40:09,008 --> 01:40:12,341
Heyo dadee
Big Boss Nass, Your Honour.

1223
01:40:13,138 --> 01:40:15,545
Jar Jar Binks.

1224
01:40:16,057 --> 01:40:19,307
Who's da uss-en uthers?

1225
01:40:19,895 --> 01:40:22,183
I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1226
01:40:23,023 --> 01:40:25,430
I come before you in peace.

1227
01:40:25,567 --> 01:40:28,402
Ah, Naboo biggen.

1228
01:40:28,529 --> 01:40:31,695
Yousa bringen da Mackineeks.

1229
01:40:31,824 --> 01:40:35,524
Yousa all bombad.

1230
01:40:36,412 --> 01:40:39,247
We have searched you out
because we wish to form an alliance.

1231
01:40:39,373 --> 01:40:40,748
Your Honour.

1232
01:40:42,918 --> 01:40:45,872
Whosa dis?

1233
01:40:46,005 --> 01:40:48,211
I am Queen Amidala.

1234
01:40:49,884 --> 01:40:51,461
This is my decoy...

1235
01:40:51,594 --> 01:40:55,212
my protection,
my loyal bodyguard.

1236
01:40:55,348 --> 01:40:59,642
I'm sorry for my deception,
but it was necessary to protect myself.

1237
01:40:59,769 --> 01:41:02,307
Although we do not always agree,
Your Honour...

1238
01:41:02,439 --> 01:41:04,977
our two great societies
have always lived in peace.

1239
01:41:06,777 --> 01:41:09,943
The Trade Federation has destroyed all
that we have worked so hard to build.

1240
01:41:10,072 --> 01:41:13,322
If we do not act quickly,
all will be lost forever.

1241
01:41:13,450 --> 01:41:15,656
I ask you to help us.

1242
01:41:15,786 --> 01:41:18,490
No, I beg you to help us.

1243
01:41:18,622 --> 01:41:20,994
We are your humble servants.

1244
01:41:24,253 --> 01:41:27,040
Our fate is in your hands.

1245
01:41:44,274 --> 01:41:48,521
Yousa no tinken yousa
greater den da Gungans?

1246
01:41:50,989 --> 01:41:54,903
Mesa lika dis!

1247
01:41:55,952 --> 01:41:56,817
Maybe...

1248
01:41:56,953 --> 01:41:59,491
wesa...

1249
01:41:59,623 --> 01:42:01,496
being friends.

1250
01:42:10,217 --> 01:42:12,008
We've sent our patrols.

1251
01:42:12,136 --> 01:42:15,587
We already located
their starship in the swamp.

1252
01:42:15,723 --> 01:42:17,881
It won't be long, my lord.

1253
01:42:18,017 --> 01:42:21,136
This is
an unexpected move for her.

1254
01:42:21,270 --> 01:42:23,262
It's too aggressive.

1255
01:42:23,397 --> 01:42:25,804
Lord Maul, be mindful.

1256
01:42:25,942 --> 01:42:28,480
Let them make the first move.

1257
01:42:28,611 --> 01:42:30,484
Yes, my master.

1258
01:42:34,033 --> 01:42:35,693
Deysa comin!

1259
01:42:35,827 --> 01:42:37,155
All right!

1260
01:42:40,749 --> 01:42:42,457
They're here!

1261
01:42:42,584 --> 01:42:43,959
Good. They made it.

1262
01:42:48,548 --> 01:42:51,217
Yousa doen grand.

1263
01:42:51,343 --> 01:42:54,427
Jar Jar bring uss-en
and da Naboo together.

1264
01:42:54,555 --> 01:42:56,428
Oh, no, no, no.

1265
01:42:56,557 --> 01:42:59,511
So, wesa make you...

1266
01:42:59,643 --> 01:43:02,134
bombad general.

1267
01:43:02,271 --> 01:43:03,681
General?

1268
01:43:06,776 --> 01:43:08,234
Captain.

1269
01:43:08,361 --> 01:43:10,934
- Your Highness.
- What is the situation?

1270
01:43:11,072 --> 01:43:12,945
Almost everyone's in camps.

1271
01:43:13,074 --> 01:43:16,277
A few hundred police and guards formed
an underground resistance movement.

1272
01:43:16,411 --> 01:43:18,949
I brought back as many
of the leaders as I could.

1273
01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:21,950
The Federation army's also
much larger than we thought...

1274
01:43:22,083 --> 01:43:23,743
and much stronger.

1275
01:43:25,045 --> 01:43:28,129
Your Highness, this is a battle
I do not think that we can win.

1276
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:30,462
The battle is a diversion.

1277
01:43:30,592 --> 01:43:33,462
The Gungans must draw the droid army
away from the cities.

1278
01:43:33,595 --> 01:43:35,137
R2.

1279
01:43:36,264 --> 01:43:39,715
We can enter the city using the secret
passages on the waterfall side.

1280
01:43:39,851 --> 01:43:41,559
Once we get
to the main entrance...

1281
01:43:41,687 --> 01:43:44,771
Captain Panaka
will create a diversion.

1282
01:43:44,898 --> 01:43:47,815
Then we can enter the palace
and capture the viceroy.

1283
01:43:48,569 --> 01:43:51,356
Without the viceroy,
they will be lost and confused.

1284
01:43:51,489 --> 01:43:53,149
What do you think, Master Jedi?

1285
01:43:53,282 --> 01:43:55,440
The viceroy will be well-guarded.

1286
01:43:55,576 --> 01:43:58,067
The difficulty is getting
into the throne room.

1287
01:43:58,204 --> 01:44:00,492
Once we're inside,
we shouldn't have a problem.

1288
01:44:00,623 --> 01:44:05,332
There is a possibility, with this
diversion, many Gungans will be killed.

1289
01:44:05,461 --> 01:44:08,746
Wesa ready to do our-san part.

1290
01:44:08,882 --> 01:44:12,001
We have a plan which should
immobilize the droid army.

1291
01:44:12,135 --> 01:44:14,008
We will send
what pilots we have...

1292
01:44:14,137 --> 01:44:17,173
to knock out the droid control ship
orbiting the planet.

1293
01:44:17,307 --> 01:44:20,343
A well-conceived plan.
However, there's great risk.

1294
01:44:20,477 --> 01:44:23,596
The weapons on your fighters
may not penetrate the shields.

1295
01:44:23,730 --> 01:44:25,354
There's an even bigger danger.

1296
01:44:25,482 --> 01:44:27,355
If the viceroy escapes,
Your Highness...

1297
01:44:27,484 --> 01:44:29,690
he will return
with another droid army.

1298
01:44:29,820 --> 01:44:33,023
Well, that is why we must not fail
to get the viceroy.

1299
01:44:33,157 --> 01:44:35,066
Everything depends on it.

1300
01:44:40,414 --> 01:44:43,035
She is more foolish
than I thought.

1301
01:44:43,167 --> 01:44:45,124
We are sending all troops...

1302
01:44:45,252 --> 01:44:48,122
to meet this army
assembling near the swamp.

1303
01:44:48,256 --> 01:44:50,877
It appears to be made up
of primitives.

1304
01:44:51,008 --> 01:44:53,546
This will work to our advantage.

1305
01:44:53,678 --> 01:44:56,465
I have your approval
to proceed, then, my lord?

1306
01:44:57,265 --> 01:44:58,973
Wipe them out.

1307
01:45:00,685 --> 01:45:02,558
All of them.

1308
01:45:33,469 --> 01:45:34,844
Halt!

1309
01:45:38,307 --> 01:45:40,548
Starting up the shield.

1310
01:46:10,090 --> 01:46:11,288
Open fire.

1311
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:30,603
Once we get inside, you find
a safe place to hide and stay there.

1312
01:46:30,737 --> 01:46:32,646
- Sure.
- Stay there.

1313
01:46:48,630 --> 01:46:50,669
Roger, roger.

1314
01:46:58,724 --> 01:47:01,843
I thought the battle was going
to take place far from here.

1315
01:47:02,937 --> 01:47:04,431
This is too close.

1316
01:47:10,403 --> 01:47:12,775
Ani, find cover.

1317
01:47:12,905 --> 01:47:15,193
- Quick!
- Get to your ships!

1318
01:48:13,968 --> 01:48:15,082
Fighters straight ahead.

1319
01:48:15,220 --> 01:48:16,334
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1320
01:48:16,471 --> 01:48:17,669
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1321
01:48:26,356 --> 01:48:27,435
Cease fire.

1322
01:48:34,990 --> 01:48:37,397
Steady. Steady.

1323
01:49:10,527 --> 01:49:13,730
- Activate the droids.
- Yes, sir.

1324
01:49:30,256 --> 01:49:32,165
Ouch time.

1325
01:49:46,272 --> 01:49:47,351
Fire!

1326
01:50:09,630 --> 01:50:11,456
My guess is the viceroy's
in the throne room.

1327
01:50:11,590 --> 01:50:13,048
Red group! Blue group!

1328
01:50:13,175 --> 01:50:14,966
Everybody, this way!

1329
01:50:15,094 --> 01:50:17,133
Hey, wait for me!

1330
01:50:17,263 --> 01:50:19,635
Anakin, stay where you are.
You'll be safe there.

1331
01:50:19,765 --> 01:50:21,757
- But I-
- Stay in that cockpit.

1332
01:50:33,946 --> 01:50:37,149
- We'll handle this.
- We'll take the long way.

1333
01:50:57,346 --> 01:50:59,255
We gotta do something, R2.

1334
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:25,081
I'm trying to!
I don't know where the trigger is!

1335
01:51:28,545 --> 01:51:31,581
Oops, wrong one.
Maybe it's this one.

1336
01:51:32,590 --> 01:51:35,041
Nope. Wait. Here it is.

1337
01:51:37,262 --> 01:51:38,210
Yeah!

1338
01:51:43,602 --> 01:51:45,096
Let's go!

1339
01:51:46,188 --> 01:51:48,429
It's on automatic pilot.

1340
01:51:57,533 --> 01:51:59,406
Try to override it.

1341
01:52:59,472 --> 01:53:01,381
We don't have time for this,
Captain.

1342
01:53:07,522 --> 01:53:09,348
Look, there they are.

1343
01:53:09,482 --> 01:53:11,854
That's where
the autopilot's taking us.

1344
01:53:28,877 --> 01:53:31,498
Dumb droid. Take that!

1345
01:53:31,630 --> 01:53:33,539
Get off! Get off! Get off!

1346
01:53:33,674 --> 01:53:34,836
Get off!

1347
01:53:44,894 --> 01:53:47,266
The deflector shield
is too strong.

1348
01:53:56,573 --> 01:53:58,233
This is tense!

1349
01:54:00,535 --> 01:54:02,527
R2, get us off this autopilot.

1350
01:54:02,662 --> 01:54:04,535
It's gonna get us both killed.

1351
01:54:06,208 --> 01:54:08,615
You did it, R2!

1352
01:54:08,752 --> 01:54:09,950
Let's go left.

1353
01:54:15,175 --> 01:54:16,289
Go back?

1354
01:54:16,427 --> 01:54:20,721
Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit,
so that's what I'm gonna do.

1355
01:54:27,605 --> 01:54:30,060
I'll try spinning.
That's a good trick.

1356
01:54:35,738 --> 01:54:38,276
I know we're in trouble.
Just hang on.

1357
01:54:45,123 --> 01:54:46,118
Go!

1358
01:54:50,962 --> 01:54:52,670
Ascension guns!

1359
01:56:58,845 --> 01:57:00,469
Retreat! Retreat!

1360
01:57:02,223 --> 01:57:04,132
Dis is nutsen.

1361
01:57:14,027 --> 01:57:15,984
Uh-oh. Big boomers.

1362
01:57:36,717 --> 01:57:39,124
Give me a lift!

1363
01:57:46,394 --> 01:57:47,971
Jar Jar, usen da booma!

1364
01:57:48,104 --> 01:57:50,013
What?
Mesa no have a booma!

1365
01:57:50,148 --> 01:57:52,105
Here. Taken dis one.

1366
01:58:08,542 --> 01:58:09,621
Jar Jar!

1367
01:58:09,751 --> 01:58:11,708
Jump,Jar Jar, jump!

1368
01:58:21,889 --> 01:58:24,676
Put down your weapons.
They win this round.

1369
01:58:37,613 --> 01:58:39,736
We're hit, R2!

1370
01:58:52,963 --> 01:58:55,917
I'm trying to stop!
I'm trying to stop!

1371
01:59:03,140 --> 01:59:04,682
Everything's overheated.

1372
01:59:06,143 --> 01:59:08,100
Oops. This is not good.

1373
02:00:20,553 --> 02:00:22,759
No giben up, General Jar Jar.

1374
02:00:22,889 --> 02:00:24,762
Mesa think of something.

1375
02:00:24,891 --> 02:00:26,266
Hands up.

1376
02:00:26,393 --> 02:00:29,263
My give up. My give up.

1377
02:00:37,988 --> 02:00:41,107
Your little insurrection
is at an end, Your Highness.

1378
02:00:41,241 --> 02:00:43,114
Time for you
to sign the treaty and end...

1379
02:00:43,243 --> 02:00:45,116
this pointless debate in the senate.

1380
02:00:45,245 --> 02:00:46,988
Viceroy!

1381
02:00:47,122 --> 02:00:49,031
Your occupation here has ended.

1382
02:00:50,626 --> 02:00:53,995
After her.
This one's a decoy.

1383
02:01:00,595 --> 02:01:02,053
Captain!

1384
02:01:11,314 --> 02:01:13,353
Jam the doors.

1385
02:01:16,820 --> 02:01:19,690
Now, Viceroy,
we will discuss a new treaty.

1386
02:02:22,888 --> 02:02:25,379
Yes! We have power.
Shields up.

1387
02:02:28,686 --> 02:02:29,717
Take this!

1388
02:02:31,730 --> 02:02:32,809
And this!

1389
02:02:40,698 --> 02:02:42,441
- Oops.
- We're losing power.

1390
02:02:42,575 --> 02:02:44,401
There seems to be a problem
with the main reactor.

1391
02:02:44,535 --> 02:02:45,910
Impossible!

1392
02:02:46,037 --> 02:02:47,910
Nothing can get through our shield.

1393
02:02:49,207 --> 02:02:50,998
Let's get outta here.

1394
02:02:59,050 --> 02:03:01,671
What's that?
It's blowing up from the inside!

1395
02:03:04,723 --> 02:03:06,300
We didn't hit it.

1396
02:03:09,394 --> 02:03:11,433
Now, this is Podracing.

1397
02:03:13,065 --> 02:03:14,773
Look, one of ours,
out of the main hold!

1398
02:03:36,172 --> 02:03:37,630
What the-

1399
02:03:37,757 --> 02:03:39,963
Was'n they doing?

1400
02:03:40,093 --> 02:03:43,675
The control ship
has been destroyed. Look!

1401
02:03:45,390 --> 02:03:47,715
They all broke-ed.

1402
02:04:36,151 --> 02:04:39,520
No, it's too late.

1403
02:04:39,654 --> 02:04:41,942
- No.
- Obi-Wan.

1404
02:04:43,241 --> 02:04:45,114
Promise-

1405
02:04:45,244 --> 02:04:47,782
Promise me
you will train the boy.

1406
02:04:47,913 --> 02:04:49,455
Yes, Master.

1407
02:04:53,544 --> 02:04:56,117
He is the chosen one.

1408
02:04:56,255 --> 02:04:59,458
He will bring balance.

1409
02:05:00,676 --> 02:05:02,086
Train him.

1410
02:05:29,623 --> 02:05:31,414
Now, Viceroy...

1411
02:05:31,541 --> 02:05:34,957
you're going to have to go back
to the senate and explain all this.

1412
02:05:36,713 --> 02:05:39,998
I think you can kiss
your trade franchise goodbye.

1413
02:05:53,731 --> 02:05:57,265
We are indebted to you
for your bravery, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

1414
02:05:57,402 --> 02:05:59,275
And you, young Skywalker.

1415
02:06:00,071 --> 02:06:03,356
We will watch your career
with great interest.

1416
02:06:09,914 --> 02:06:12,452
Congratulations on your election,
Chancellor.

1417
02:06:12,584 --> 02:06:16,000
Your boldness has saved our people,
Your Majesty.

1418
02:06:16,129 --> 02:06:18,501
It's you who should be
congratulated.

1419
02:06:18,632 --> 02:06:22,546
Together we shall bring peace
and prosperity to the Republic.

1420
02:06:27,599 --> 02:06:32,011
Confer on you the level
of Jedi knight the council does.

1421
02:06:32,146 --> 02:06:36,855
But agree with your taking this boy
as your Padawan learner...

1422
02:06:36,984 --> 02:06:38,857
I do not.

1423
02:06:38,986 --> 02:06:41,062
Qui-Gon believed in him.

1424
02:06:43,991 --> 02:06:46,660
The chosen one the boy may be.

1425
02:06:46,786 --> 02:06:48,410
Nevertheless...

1426
02:06:48,538 --> 02:06:51,408
grave danger I fear
in his training.

1427
02:06:51,541 --> 02:06:55,669
Master Yoda,
I gave Qui-Gon my word.

1428
02:06:55,795 --> 02:06:57,704
I will train Anakin.

1429
02:06:59,966 --> 02:07:02,291
Without the approval
of the council, if I must.

1430
02:07:02,427 --> 02:07:04,882
Qui-Gon's defiance
I sense in you.

1431
02:07:05,013 --> 02:07:06,922
Need that you do not.

1432
02:07:09,184 --> 02:07:12,434
Agree with you the council does.

1433
02:07:13,564 --> 02:07:16,849
Your apprentice Skywalker will be.

1434
02:07:44,679 --> 02:07:46,422
What will happen to me now?

1435
02:07:46,556 --> 02:07:49,592
The council have granted me
permission to train you.

1436
02:07:49,726 --> 02:07:53,142
You will be a Jedi, I promise.

1437
02:08:02,573 --> 02:08:05,942
There's no doubt
the mysterious warrior was a Sith.

1438
02:08:06,076 --> 02:08:08,531
Always two there are.

1439
02:08:08,662 --> 02:08:11,865
No more, no less.

1440
02:08:11,999 --> 02:08:14,916
A master and an apprentice.

1441
02:08:15,044 --> 02:08:16,586
But which was destroyed?

1442
02:08:16,712 --> 02:08:19,666
The master or the apprentice?

1443
02:08:44,324 --> 02:08:46,363
Hidoe, everybody!

1444
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:34,909
Peace!
