# What Kind of Guarantees?

* Does my sorting function return sensible result?
    ```haskell
        sort :: [a] → SortedList a
        -- vs.
        sort :: [a] ⊸ SortedList a
    ```
* Can I do in-place updates?

* Do I close my file handles?

---

# Approach: Linear Arrows

`f :: s ⊸ t` assures that: 

* **if** `(f u)` is _consumed_ exactly once,

* **then** the argument `u` is _consumed_ exactly once.

--

_Consume_ ::=

* To consume a **value of atomic base type** (like `Int` or `Ptr`) exactly once, just _evaluate_ it.

* To consume a **function** value exactly once, apply it to one argument, and consume its result exactly once.

* To consume a **value of an algebraic datatype** exactly once, pattern-match on it, and consume all its linear components exactly once.

---

# Example: List Concatenation

```haskell
-- List datatype
data [a] = []               -- empty
         | a : [a]          -- : ~ cons

(++) :: [a] ⊸ [a] ⊸ [a]   -- Type annotation

-- Definition by pattern matching on first argument:
[]       ++ ys = ys
(x : xs) ++ ys = x : (xs ++ ys)
```

--

⇒ Datatype contructors are linear by default. 

(Don't like this? We can do a la carte)

---

# Datatype Linearity a la Carte

_Task_ Function `f` needs a pair to use its components non-symmetrically  
(say, first one linearly, second — unrestrictedly)

--
```haskell
data PLU a b where 
    PLU :: a ⊸ b → PLU a b

f :: PLU (MArray Int) Int ⊸ MArray Int

```
--
Even better:
```haskell
data U a where                  -- Unrestricted resource
    U :: a → U a
    
f :: (MArray Int, U Int) ⊸ MArray Int
```

---

# Different Arrows Interplay Nicely

.left-half[
```haskell
f :: s ⊸ t
g :: s → t
g x = f x
```
]
--
.right-half[
```haskell
sum :: [Int] ⊸ Int
f   :: [Int] ⊸ [Int] → Int
f xs ys = sum (xs ++ ys) + sum ys
```
]

--

.left-half[
```haskell
f1 :: (Int, Int) → (Int, Int)
f1 x = case x of (a, b) → (a, a)

f2 :: (Int, Int) ⊸ (Int, Int)
f2 x = case x of (a, b) → (b, a)

f3 :: (Int, U Int) ⊸ (Int, Int)
f3 x = case x of (a, _) → (42, a)
```

#Multiplicity Polymorphism

Is `map` of `(a ⊸ b) → [a] ⊸ [b]` or of `(a → b) → [a] → [b]`?

--

Neither, it is

```haskell
map :: ∀p. (a →_p b) → [a] →_p [b]
```

--

So we abbreviate:

* `⊸` ::= `→₁`

* `→` ::= <code>→<sub>ω</sub></code>

Thus, we have two multiplicities: 1 and ω.

# Midterm: Typing Function Composition

```haskell
(◦) :: 
    ∀p q.    (b →_p c)
    ⊸       (a →_q b)
    →_p      a
    →_{???}  c
(f ◦ g) x = f (g x)
```
---

# Midterm: Typing Function Composition

```haskell
(◦) :: 
    ∀p q.    (b →_p c)
    ⊸       (a →_q b)
    →_p      a
    →_{p·q}  c
(f ◦ g) x = f (g x)
```

#Linear Arrows vs Linear Kinds

- Strictness & Divergence

.left-half[
```haskell
f :: a ⊸ (a, Bool)
f x = (x, True)
```
]
.right-half[
``` haskell
g :: [Int] ⊸ [Int]
g xs = repeat 1 ++ xs
```
]

- Exceptions

--

- Single type universe

--

- It can play nicely with dependent function types too!

---

# On the other hand … 

How to use `⊸` when one expects `→`, e.g.:
```haskell
f :: Int ⊸ Int
g :: (Int → Int) → Bool
h = g f -- Legal???
```
In general, do we want `⊸ <: →`?

--

Mom told me: don't mix HM and subtyping! So let's make a hack:
```haskell
h = g f ↝  g (λx → f x)
```
This has certain tradeoffs…

---

# On the other hand … (contd.)

Can we have linear return types?

--

We are smart and can invent “encodings”:
```haskell
f :: A → (B ⊸ !r) ⊸ r -- f effectively accepts A and returns linear B
```
--
This plays nicely with monads!

```haskell
type IO p a

return :: a →_p IO p a
bind   :: IO p a ⊸ (a →_p IO q b) ⊸ IO q b
```

---

# Larger Example: Linear Input/Output

```haskell
printHandle :: File ⊸ IO ω ()
printHandle f = do
                 { (f, U b) ← atEOF f
                 ; if b then closeFile f
                   else do { (f, U c) ← read f 
                           ; putChar c
                           ; printHandle f } }
```

```haskell
atEOF     :: File ⊸ IO 1 (File, U Bool)
closeFile :: File ⊸ IO ω ()
read      :: File ⊸ IO 1 (File, U Char)
putChar   :: Char → IO ω ()
```
```haskell
do { x ← a; f x }      ~       bind a (\x → f x)
```

**Typing $\lambda_{\to}^q$:** `Γ ⊢ t : A`  
.small[consuming `t : A` exactly once will consume each binding `(x :_π A)` in Γ with multiplicity π]

# Coda: Threats To Validity

* Huge overhaul: change the whole `base`, also modification of GHC Core

--

* Retrofitting still not completely thought of

    * GHC Proposals process is staling
    
    * Multiplicity 0 is already dropped

--

* Type inference is not formally developed

--

* Generally, elaboration of LH to $\lambda_{\to}^q$ (or GHC Core) is not 100% clear

---

# On the bright side

* A lot of work has been done.

--

* Efficiency is on its way:

    * some reported in the paper (ad-hoc);
    
    * some of «cardinality&nbsp;analysis» subsumed by multiplicity annotations
    (good for inling: e.g. don't inline `(λx → x ++ x) expensive`).

--

* Many applications in mind:

    * network-communication with 0 allocations,
    * GC-less, manual allocations,
    * resource-safe I/O,
    * safe API for the `streaming` library,
    * DSL for “printable” 3D-models.
